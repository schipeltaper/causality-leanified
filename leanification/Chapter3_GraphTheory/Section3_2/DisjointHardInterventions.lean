# Disjoint hard interventions and node-splittings commute (`claim_3_8`)

This file formalises the LN lemma `claim_3_8` (`DisjointHardInterventions`)
in section 3.2 of `graphs.tex`:

> Let `G = (J, V, E, L)` be a CDMG and `W₁ ⊆ J ∪ V`, `W₂ ⊆ V` two
> subsets of nodes of `G` with `W₁ ∩ W₂ = ∅`.  Then
> `(G_{doit(W₁)})_{spl(W₂)} = (G_{spl(W₂)})_{doit(W₁)}`.

The authoritative spec is the rewritten canonical tex statement at
`leanification/Chapter3_GraphTheory/Section3_2/tex/`
`claim_3_8_statement_DisjointHardInterventions.tex`, verified
equivalent to the LN block (`addition_to_the_LN` empty).

## Carrier reading (load-bearing for this row's Lean signature)

`def_3_10` (`hardInterventionOn`) preserves the node carrier (`Node → Node`)
while `def_3_11` (`nodeSplittingOn`) lifts the carrier
(`Node → SplitNode Node`).  Both sides of the asserted equality therefore
land in `CDMG (SplitNode Node)`:

* LHS `(G.hardInterventionOn W₁ hW₁).nodeSplittingOn W₂ _` — the inner
  hard intervention keeps the carrier as `Node`; the outer
  `nodeSplittingOn` lifts to `SplitNode Node`.
* RHS `(G.nodeSplittingOn W₂ hW₂).hardInterventionOn (W₁.image .unsplit) _`
  — the inner `nodeSplittingOn` lifts to `SplitNode Node`, and the outer
  hard intervention operates on the lifted carrier.  `W₁` is lifted to
  the split-graph carrier via `.image SplitNode.unsplit`, faithful to the
  tex spec's "carrier-reading" paragraph: every `w ∈ W₁` satisfies
  `w ∈ J ∪ V` (by `hW₁`) and `w ∉ W₂` (by disjointness), so `w` injects
  as its unsplit copy `.unsplit w` in the split-graph carrier.

Both sides have the same Lean type `CDMG (SplitNode Node)`, so the
equality is a *literal* `=` of CDMGs — NOT the
`eqViaNodeMap`/`flattenSplit` shape used by `claim_3_7`
(`TwoDisjointNode`), where iterating `nodeSplittingOn` twice produces
the nested carrier `SplitNode (SplitNode Node)` and required a
canonical-flatten relabelling.  Mirrors the literal-`=` pattern of
`claim_3_4` (`HardInterventionsCommute`).

The body is filled in by `prove_claim_in_lean` (Manager B), following
the to-be-written tex proof at
`tex/claim_3_8_proof_DisjointHardInterventions.tex` (the LN already
ships a worked proof at `graphs.tex` L504–534).

namespace CDMG

-- `Node : Type*` with `[DecidableEq Node]`.  Inherited from `def_3_1`
-- (`CDMG.lean`).  Load-bearing because the signature references
-- `CDMG Node`, `G.hardInterventionOn` (`def_3_10`), and
-- `G.nodeSplittingOn` (`def_3_11`), each of which depends on
-- `[DecidableEq Node]` through `Finset`-backed membership and image
-- operations.  The split-graph carrier `SplitNode Node` inherits
-- `[DecidableEq (SplitNode Node)]` automatically via the `deriving
-- DecidableEq` clause on `SplitNode` (`NodeSplittingOn.lean`).

-- ## Helper — `W₂` sits inside the carrier of the inner hard intervention
--
-- The LHS `(G.hardInterventionOn W₁ hW₁).nodeSplittingOn W₂ ?_` requires
-- `?_ : W₂ ⊆ (G.hardInterventionOn W₁ hW₁).V`, i.e.\
-- `W₂ ⊆ G.V \ W₁` per `def_3_10` item ii.  The rewritten tex's
-- "Well-typedness of the inner splitting on the LHS" paragraph proves
-- this from `W₂ ⊆ G.V` and `W₁ ∩ W₂ = ∅` (`Disjoint W₁ W₂`).
--
-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Standalone helper, not an inline `by`-block in the theorem signature.*
--   The LHS's outer `nodeSplittingOn W₂ ?_` needs a *proof term* for
--   the inner-`hW` argument of `def_3_11`'s constructor, not a tactic
--   blob.  Inlining a `by`-block in the type was rejected because
--   (i) it would clutter the rendered statement on the website with
--   pure carrier-subset bookkeeping, and (ii) it would duplicate the
--   same `(G.V ∖ W₁)`-arithmetic at every future `doit`-then-`spl`
--   use site.  Mirrors the `subset_carrier_of_hardInterventionOn`
--   pattern from `claim_3_4` (`HardInterventionsCommute`).
--
-- *Hypothesis shape `Disjoint W₁ W₂`, not `W₁ ∩ W₂ = ∅` or
--   `W₂ ⊆ G.V ∖ W₁`.*  `Disjoint W₁ W₂` is the canonical Mathlib
--   `Finset` form and feeds `Finset.disjoint_right.mp hDisj hv : v ∉ W₁`
--   in one step.  Encoding the LN's "$W_1 \cap W_2 = \emptyset$" as a
--   raw `Finset.inter` equality would force a `Finset.mem_inter`
--   rewrite at every use site; encoding it as `W₂ ⊆ G.V ∖ W₁` would
--   couple this helper to the LHS-only reading and would not survive
--   a `Disjoint.symm` swap.  The `Disjoint` form is also what the
--   main theorem's `hDisj` binder ships, so no conversion is needed
--   at the call site.
--
-- *Implicit `G`, `W₁`, `W₂`; explicit `hW₁`, `hW₂`, `hDisj`.*  Mirrors
--   the binder convention of `def_3_10` and `def_3_11`.  At the call
--   site `subset_V_of_hardInterventionOn hW₁ hW₂ hDisj`, the implicit
--   arguments are synthesised from the goal and the call reads
--   left-to-right as "the inner intervention is on `W₁` via `hW₁`;
--   the carrier-target is `W₂` via `hW₂`; disjointness via `hDisj`".
--
-- *`private`, with helper markers.*  Localises the lemma to this file
--   so the `CDMG` namespace stays clean.  Helper markers wrap it so
--   the website builder pulls it out alongside the rendered statement
--   (without which the theorem head would reference an undefined
--   symbol).  Downstream `doit`-then-`spl` rows (chapter 5 do-calculus,
--   the disjoint-intervention algebra of ch.\ 8+) should re-introduce
--   the same private helper at their use site rather than reach
--   across files; if a chapter-wide reuse pattern emerges, it can be
--   promoted in a later refactor.
--
-- *Mathlib re-use.*  Built directly on `Finset.mem_sdiff` and
--   `Finset.disjoint_right`; no rolled-our-own abstraction is needed.

-- ## Helper — `W₁.image .unsplit` sits inside the carrier of the inner node-splitting
--
-- The RHS `(G.nodeSplittingOn W₂ hW₂).hardInterventionOn
-- (W₁.image SplitNode.unsplit) ?_` requires
-- `?_ : W₁.image .unsplit ⊆
--        (G.nodeSplittingOn W₂ hW₂).J ∪ (G.nodeSplittingOn W₂ hW₂).V`.
-- For each `v ∈ W₁`: `v ∈ G.J ∪ G.V` by `hW₁`; if `v ∈ G.J` then
-- `.unsplit v ∈ G.J.image .unsplit = (G.nodeSplittingOn W₂ hW₂).J`; if
-- `v ∈ G.V` then `v ∉ W₂` by `Disjoint W₁ W₂`, so `v ∈ G.V \ W₂` and
-- `.unsplit v ∈ (G.V \ W₂).image .unsplit ⊆
-- (G.nodeSplittingOn W₂ hW₂).V`.  The rewritten tex's "Carrier reading
-- of the equality" paragraph spells this out.
--
-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Standalone helper, not an inline `by`-block in the theorem signature.*
--   Symmetric reason to the LHS helper above: the RHS's outer
--   `hardInterventionOn (W₁.image .unsplit) ?_` needs a *proof term*
--   for the inner-`hW` argument of `def_3_10`'s constructor, not a
--   tactic blob.  Inlining a `by`-block in the type would clutter the
--   website-rendered statement with split-graph carrier arithmetic and
--   would duplicate the same `.unsplit`-injection reasoning at every
--   future `spl`-then-`doit` use site.  Mirrors the
--   `subset_carrier_of_hardInterventionOn` pattern from `claim_3_4`
--   and the sibling LHS helper above.
--
-- *Lift `W₁` via `Finset.image SplitNode.unsplit`, not via a fresh
--   `Finset` on the split carrier.*  The `unsplit` constructor of
--   `def_3_11`'s `SplitNode` is the type-level realisation of the LN's
--   "$v \in J \cup (V \sm W)$ stays in the carrier as itself" reading
--   — so `.image SplitNode.unsplit` tags each `w ∈ W₁` as a node that
--   the inner splitting on `W₂` left alone, faithful to the rewritten
--   tex's "Carrier reading of the equality" paragraph.  Forcing the
--   consumer to construct a fresh `Finset (SplitNode Node)` of "the
--   right copies of the nodes in `W₁`" and re-prove its
--   carrier-subset relation from scratch was rejected because it
--   discards the structural fact that *no* node of `W₁` is split (by
--   disjointness), losing the LN's clean "unsplit-injection" reading.
--   The same lift convention is used in `claim_3_7` for its
--   `W₂.image .unsplit` argument; reusing it here keeps the
--   formalisations parallel.
--
-- *Disjointness `Disjoint W₁ W₂` is load-bearing for the `V`-piece,
--   inert on the `J`-piece.*  When `v ∈ W₁ ∩ G.J`, the lift lands
--   directly in `G.J.image .unsplit = (G.nodeSplittingOn W₂ hW₂).J`,
--   *without* using disjointness — `def_3_11` leaves the input-node
--   side untouched.  Disjointness only enters when `v ∈ W₁ ∩ G.V`,
--   where we need `v ∉ W₂` to place the lift in
--   `(G.V ∖ W₂).image .unsplit` (the only piece of `(split).V` that
--   contains `.unsplit` constructors).  Surfacing this asymmetry in
--   the lemma body — the two `rcases` branches — keeps the consumer's
--   reading aligned with `def_3_11`'s carrier construction.
--
-- *`private`, with helper markers.*  Same rationale as the LHS
--   helper: file-local so the `CDMG` namespace stays clean, pulled by
--   the website builder alongside the rendered statement so the
--   theorem head does not reference an undefined symbol.  Downstream
--   `spl`-then-`doit` rows with a disjointness side condition (this
--   row's converse, and the do-calculus interactions in ch.\ 5)
--   should re-introduce the same pattern at their use site rather
--   than reach across files.
--
-- *Mathlib re-use.*  Built on `Finset.mem_image`, `Finset.mem_union`,
--   `Finset.mem_sdiff`, and `Finset.disjoint_left`; the case-split on
--   `v ∈ G.J ∪ G.V` uses `Finset.mem_union.mp (hW₁ hv)`.  No
--   rolled-our-own abstraction is needed.

-- ref: claim_3_8
-- For any CDMG `G : CDMG Node` and any two subsets `W₁ ⊆ G.J ∪ G.V`,
-- `W₂ ⊆ G.V` with `Disjoint W₁ W₂`, the LN equality
--   `(G_{doit(W₁)})_{spl(W₂)} = (G_{spl(W₂)})_{doit(W₁)}`
-- holds as a literal `=` of CDMGs over the split-graph carrier
-- `SplitNode Node`.
/-
LN tex (rewritten canonical statement for `claim_3_8`):

  Let `G = (J, V, E, L)` be a CDMG and `W₁ ⊆ J ∪ V`, `W₂ ⊆ V` subject
  to `W₁ ∩ W₂ = ∅`.  Then
    `(G_{doit(W₁)})_{spl(W₂)} = (G_{spl(W₂)})_{doit(W₁)}`,
  read as a literal `=` of CDMGs over the split-graph carrier (NOT up
  to a carrier-relabelling map): the inner `spl(W₂)` on the LHS is
  well-defined because `W₂ ⊆ V \ W₁ = V_{doit(W₁)}`; the outer
  `doit(W₁)` on the RHS is well-defined because `W₁`'s nodes inject
  into the split-graph carrier as their unsplit copies `.unsplit w`
  (every `w ∈ W₁` lies in `J ∪ (V ∖ W₂)` by disjointness).

LN block (verbatim, for backup):

  Let `G = (J, V, E, L)` be a CDMG and `W_1 ⊆ J ∪ V` and `W_2 ⊆ V` two
  disjoint subsets of nodes of `G`.  Then the CDMG obtained from first
  hard intervening on `W_1` and then node-splitting `W_2` is the same
  CDMG that arises from first node-splitting `W_2` and then hard
  intervening on `W_1`:
    `(G_{doit(W_1)})_{spl(W_2)} = (G_{spl(W_2)})_{doit(W_1)}`.
-/
-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Literal `=` of CDMGs over `SplitNode Node`, NOT
--   `eqViaNodeMap` / `flattenSplit`.*  This is the single most
--   important shape decision for this row and the reason the
--   formalisation is structurally simpler than `claim_3_7`
--   (`TwoDisjointNode`).  Both sides take a *single* node-splitting
--   on the same `W₂`, and `hardInterventionOn` preserves the node
--   carrier (`CDMG α → CDMG α` per `def_3_10`), so both sides land in
--   `CDMG (SplitNode Node)` — no carrier mismatch arises and the
--   asserted equality is a literal `=` between two terms of identical
--   Lean type.  Contrast with `claim_3_7`, where iterating
--   `nodeSplittingOn` twice produces `CDMG (SplitNode (SplitNode Node))`
--   on both sides with the constructor wrappings of the same
--   underlying graph node disagreeing between the two iteration orders
--   (`.unsplit (.copy0 w)` vs `.copy0 (.unsplit w)`), forcing the
--   `eqViaNodeMap` / `flattenSplit` workaround.  Here the LN's "the
--   same CDMG" reading is delivered by Lean's structural `=`; no
--   carrier-relabelling map, no `Finset.image` chase through a
--   flatten function, no quotient types.  Mirrors the literal-`=`
--   pattern of `claim_3_4` (`HardInterventionsCommute`), now lifted
--   to the `SplitNode Node` carrier.
--
-- *Disjointness `Disjoint W₁ W₂` is genuinely load-bearing, not a
--   convenience hypothesis.*  Two distinct uses inside the signature:
--   (i) the LHS's inner `spl(W₂)` needs
--   `W₂ ⊆ G.V ∖ W₁ = V_{doit(W_1)}` (discharged by
--   `subset_V_of_hardInterventionOn`); (ii) the RHS's outer
--   `doit(W₁.image .unsplit)` needs the unsplit-lifted `W₁` to sit
--   inside `G.J.image .unsplit ∪ (G.V ∖ W₂).image .unsplit`
--   (discharged by `image_unsplit_subset_carrier_of_nodeSplittingOn`).
--   Both helpers consume `Disjoint W₁ W₂`.  Without it, a node
--   `w ∈ W₁ ∩ W₂` would simultaneously be hard-intervened (becomes an
--   input on one side) and split (gets new copies `w⁰`, `w¹` on the
--   other), and the iterated operations would commit to incompatible
--   carrier placements; the equality would no longer hold even
--   set-theoretically.  Encoded as Mathlib's `Disjoint W₁ W₂` rather
--   than as a raw `Finset.inter` equality, mirroring the helper
--   convention and matching `claim_3_7`'s hypothesis shape.
--
-- *`W₁.image SplitNode.unsplit` on the RHS, not a fresh `Finset` on
--   the split carrier.*  Faithful to the rewritten tex's "Carrier
--   reading of the equality" paragraph: every `w ∈ W₁` lies in
--   `J ∪ (V ∖ W₂)` (by `hW₁` and disjointness with `W₂`), i.e.\ the
--   untagged piece of the split-graph carrier under `def_3_11`'s
--   shorthand "$v^0 := v^1 := v$ for $v \in J \cup (V \sm W_2)$".
--   At the Lean level this untagged piece is exactly the image of
--   `SplitNode.unsplit`.  Lifting via `.image .unsplit` lets the
--   RHS's outer `hardInterventionOn` be expressed in terms of the
--   *original* `W₁` (rather than forcing the consumer to construct a
--   fresh `Finset (SplitNode Node)` and re-prove its carrier-subset
--   relation from scratch).  The same lift convention is used in
--   `claim_3_7` for its `W₂.image .unsplit` argument; reusing it here
--   keeps the two formalisations parallel and makes downstream
--   composition lemmas easier to state.
--
-- *Single theorem, not a conjunction.*  The LN statement is a single
--   equality `LHS = RHS`, not a triple equality `A = B = C` of the
--   kind that `claim_3_4` and `claim_3_7` decomposed into `(a) ∧ (b)`.
--   There is no "joint intervention" form analogous to
--   `G_{do(W₁ ∪ W₂)}` here, because `doit` and `spl` are
--   structurally distinct operations (different carriers, different
--   field equations) and do not admit a single combined invocation.
--   Hence the natural Lean rendering is a single `theorem` with a
--   single `=`, with no `.1` / `.2` projection split.
--
-- *`addition_to_the_LN` is empty.*  No deviation or addition drove
--   any shape choice; the LN block's wording is the entire spec.
--   The `def_3_10` registered deviation
--   `hard_intervention_l_symmetrized_removal` (two-sided filter on
--   `L` instead of one-sided) is inherited from the operation level
--   but does not surface as a hypothesis at the statement level — it
--   only affects the bidirected-edge componentwise check inside the
--   proof body (Manager B's responsibility).
--
-- *Mathlib re-use.*  `Finset.image`, `Disjoint`, `Finset.mem_sdiff`,
--   `Finset.disjoint_left` / `_right` underpin both helpers and the
--   theorem signature.  `Finset.union_subset` is not needed at the
--   statement level because no joint intervention form appears.  The
--   split-graph carrier `SplitNode` is our own construction from
--   `def_3_11`; no Mathlib analogue exists.
--
-- *Downstream consequences.*  Once proven, this row enables clean
--   normalisation of `doit`-then-`spl` compositions for any later
--   chapter that mixes hard interventions with node-splitting (e.g.\
--   ch.\ 5 do-calculus combined with the latent-projection
--   interpretation of `spl`, and the iterated-intervention algebra of
--   ch.\ 8+).  The literal-`=` shape means the resulting CDMG
--   equalities can be `rw`'d in place at consumer sites rather than
--   transported via an `eqViaNodeMap` predicate — significantly
--   easier to consume than the carrier-relabelling form used by
--   `claim_3_7`.  Future composition rows mixing both operations
--   should aim to preserve this literal-`=` shape whenever the
--   underlying `nodeSplittingOn` depth is constant on both sides.

--   `(G_{doit(W₁)})_{spl(W₂)} = (G_{spl(W₂)})_{doit(W₁)}`
-- holds as a literal `=` of `CDMG`s over the split-graph
-- carrier `SplitNode Node`.
--
-- ## Refactor port — proof structure
--
-- * **J / V / E sub-goals port mechanically.**  The post-refactor
--   `hardInterventionOn` and `nodeSplittingOn`
--   leave J / V / E structurally unchanged (the refactor only
--   restructures `L`).  Each sub-goal is the pre-refactor tactic
--   block with the rename pass `CDMG → CDMG`,
--   `SplitNode → SplitNode`,
--   `toCopy0 → toCopy0`, `toCopy1 → toCopy1`.
--
-- * **L sub-goal is structurally reworked for `Sym2.map`.**  The
--   pre-refactor L-side threaded the lift through `Prod.map (toCopy0
--   W₂) (toCopy0 W₂)` on ordered pairs and used the *two-sided*
--   filter `fun e => e.1 ∉ W₁ ∧ e.2 ∉ W₁` (the
--   `hard_intervention_l_symmetrized_removal` deviation, structurally
--   resolved at the `def_3_10` row under `Sym2`).  Post-refactor the
--   lift is `Sym2.map (toCopy0 W₂)` on the `Sym2`-quotient,
--   and the filter is the endpoint-universal
--   `fun s => ∀ v ∈ s, v ∉ W₁` — no two-sided workaround needed
--   because swap-symmetry is definitional on `Sym2`.  The `change`
--   step writes the underlying form; `Finset.filter_image` then swaps
--   the filter inside the image; `Finset.filter_congr` reduces to a
--   per-element predicate equivalence
--     `(∀ v ∈ s, v ∉ W₁) ↔
--        (∀ v ∈ Sym2.map (toCopy0 W₂) s,

--   (the same iff used by the original directed-edge sub-goal, now

-- * **`cdmgExt` destructures 8 fields, not 9.**  The post-refactor
--   `CDMG` has eight fields (`J`, `V`, `hJV_disj`, `E`,
--   `hE_subset`, `L`, `hL_subset`, `hL_irrefl`) — one fewer than the
--   pre-refactor nine, because `hL_symm` is gone (swap-symmetry is
--   definitional on `Sym2`).
--
-- * **Local `private instance disjointHardInterventions_decidable_bAll`
--   (declared above this comment block).**  The matching instance at
--   the `def_3_10`-twin site (`hardInterventionOn_decidable_bAll`)
--   is declared `private`, so it does not propagate to this file by
--   `import`.  We replicate the instance locally — polymorphic over
--   the underlying node type so it handles both the LHS's
--   `Sym2 Node`-filter and the RHS's `Sym2 (SplitNode
--   Node)`-filter at one declaration.  Same body as the def-site
--   instance (`Sym2.recOnSubsingleton` + `Sym2.ball`).  Mirrors the
--   pattern at `claim_3_4`'s refactor twin
--   (`hardInterventionsCommute_decidable_bAll`).
--
-- * **Literal `=` of `CDMG`s over `SplitNode Node`,
--   NOT `eqViaNodeMap` / `flattenSplit`.**  Both
--   sides take a *single* node-splitting on the same `W₂`, and
--   `hardInterventionOn` preserves the node carrier
--   (`CDMG α → CDMG α`), so both sides land in
--   `CDMG (SplitNode Node)` — no carrier mismatch
--   arises and the asserted equality is a literal `=` between two
--   terms of identical Lean type.  Contrast with `claim_3_7`'s
--   refactor twin where iterating `nodeSplittingOn` twice
--   produces `CDMG (SplitNode (SplitNode
--   Node))` on both sides with the constructor wrappings of the same
--   underlying graph node disagreeing between the two iteration
--   orders, forcing the `eqViaNodeMap` /
--   `flattenSplit` workaround.  Mirrors the literal-`=`
--   pattern of the pre-refactor `disjointHardInterventionsAndNodeSplittingsCommute`.
