# Two disjoint node-splitting hard interventions commute (`claim_3_10`)

This file formalises the LN lemma `claim_3_10` (`TwoDisjointNode`, the
SWIG / node-splitting-hard-intervention variant) in section 3.2 of
`graphs.tex`:

> Let `G = (J, V, E, L)` be a CADMG and `W₁, W₂ ⊆ V` two disjoint
> subsets of the output nodes.  Then
> `(G_{swig(W₁)})_{swig(W₂)} = (G_{swig(W₂)})_{swig(W₁)}
>   = G_{swig(W₁ ⊍ W₂)}`.

The authoritative spec is the rewritten canonical tex statement at
`leanification/Chapter3_GraphTheory/Section3_2/tex/`
`claim_3_10_statement_TwoDisjointNode.tex`, verified equivalent to the
LN block by `verify_tex_statement_only` and
`verify_tex_statement_equivalence`.  The rewritten tex decomposes the
LN's triple equality into the conjunction of two binary equalities,
mirroring `claim_3_4` (`HardInterventionsCommute`) and the sibling
`claim_3_7` (`TwoDisjointNode`, the regular node-splitting variant):

* (a) `(G_{swig(W₁)})_{swig(W₂)} = G_{swig(W₁ ∪ W₂)}`
* (b) `(G_{swig(W₂)})_{swig(W₁)} = G_{swig(W₁ ∪ W₂)}`

Transitivity of equality recovers the LN's "swap symmetry" reading
from (a) ∧ (b).

## Reuse from `claim_3_7`'s solved file (`TwoDisjointNode.lean`)

This row is the SWIG analogue of `claim_3_7`; the same
constructor-algebra infrastructure applies, because `def_3_12` (SWIG)
and `def_3_11` (regular node-splitting) share the same `SplitNode`
tagged-sum carrier (with the convention
`copy0 ↔ ^o ↔ ^0`, `copy1 ↔ ^i ↔ ^1`, `unsplit` for the residual).
We therefore import — and reuse verbatim — the following symbols from
`TwoDisjointNode.lean`:

* `flattenSplit : SplitNode (SplitNode Node) → SplitNode Node` — the
  canonical flatten map collapsing nested `SplitNode (SplitNode Node)`
  onto `SplitNode Node`.  Reusable because the cases that actually
  inhabit the iterated SWIG carrier are the same constructor
  combinations as the iterated spl carrier (with the off-carrier
  pattern-match cases filled in identically for totality and
  irrelevant to the image-level equality this row asserts).
* `eqViaNodeMap` — the "two CDMGs are equal up to the canonical
  carrier bijection" predicate, four-conjunct `Finset` equality on
  the data fields under a node map.
* (No `flatten_toCopy0_toCopy0` / `flatten_toCopy1_toCopy1` import: those
  are hypothesis-free constructor-algebra helpers Manager B's proof
  body will need, but they live inside `claim_3_7`'s theorem proof
  block — Manager B will redo them locally if needed; they are not on
  the statement surface.)

## Carrier-mismatch wrinkle (load-bearing for this row's Lean signature)

`def_3_12`'s `nodeSplittingHard` changes the node carrier
(`CDMG α → CDMG (SplitNode α)`), so the iterated splitting
`(G.nodeSplittingHard hG W₁ hW₁).nodeSplittingHard
    (swigAcyclic G hG W₁ hW₁) (W₂.image .unsplit) _`
lives in `CDMG (SplitNode (SplitNode Node))` — a formally distinct
type from the single splitting
`G.nodeSplittingHard hG (W₁ ∪ W₂) _ : CDMG (SplitNode Node)`.  The LN
identifies the two carriers set-theoretically via `def_3_12`'s
unsplit-injection convention `v^o := v^i := v` for
`v ∈ J ∪ (V ∖ W)`; the rewritten tex's "Equality up to the canonical
bijection of carriers" paragraph spells this out.  The Lean rendering
captures the identification via the imported `flattenSplit`; the LN's
"equality of CDMGs" reading becomes the imported `eqViaNodeMap`
applied with `flattenSplit` as the node map — the four `Finset` data
fields of the iterated splitting, after applying `flattenSplit`
field-wise, coincide with the four `Finset` data fields of the single
splitting.

## SWIG carrier vs. spl carrier — structural differences

The SWIG carrier is *smaller* on the `V` side than the
node-splitting carrier:

* SWIG `J_{swig(W)} := G.J.image .unsplit ∪ W.image .copy1`
* SWIG `V_{swig(W)} := (G.V ∖ W).image .unsplit ∪ W.image .copy0`
* spl  `J_{spl(W)}  := G.J.image .unsplit`
* spl  `V_{spl(W)}  := (G.V ∖ W).image .unsplit ∪ W.image .copy0 ∪
                          W.image .copy1`

The `^i` (= `.copy1`) copies sit in `J_{swig}` (input side), *not* in
`V_{swig}`.  This forces the local well-typedness helper
`image_unsplit_subset_nodeSplittingHard_V` below to be the
*two-piece-union* analogue of `claim_3_7`'s three-piece-union
`image_unsplit_subset_nodeSplittingOn_V`: a single
`Finset.mem_union_left` (into the `(G.V ∖ W₁).image .unsplit` piece)
rather than two nested `Finset.mem_union_left`s — the structural
difference traces back to `def_3_12` item ii vs. `def_3_11` item ii.

## Acyclicity requirement from `def_3_12`

Unlike `def_3_11`'s `nodeSplittingOn` (CDMG → CDMG, no acyclicity
binder), `def_3_12`'s `nodeSplittingHard` takes `(hG : G.IsCADMG)` on
its signature — see `NodeSplittingHard.lean`'s design block (d).  The
outer iterated call `(G.nodeSplittingHard hG W₁ hW₁).nodeSplittingHard
?_ ...` therefore needs an `IsCADMG` witness on the inner SWIG; this
is exactly what `claim_3_9` `swigAcyclic` provides
(`(G.nodeSplittingHard hG W hW).IsAcyclic`, definitionally equal to
`.IsCADMG` by `def_3_7` item i: `IsCADMG := IsAcyclic`).  The theorem
signature below threads `swigAcyclic G hG W₁ hW₁` (and its `W₂`-swap)
through the inner-`hG` slot of each iterated SWIG call.

The body is filled in by `prove_claim_in_lean` (Manager B), following
the to-be-written tex proof at
`tex/claim_3_10_proof_TwoDisjointNode.tex`.

-- ## Design choice — statement context
--
-- *`Node : Type*` with `[DecidableEq Node]`.*  Inherited verbatim from
--   `def_3_1` (`CDMG.lean`); load-bearing for this row's statement
--   because the signature constructs `W₁ ∪ W₂` (needs `Finset.union`),
--   `W₂.image SplitNode.unsplit` (needs `Finset.image`), and four
--   `Finset.image f` equalities inside `eqViaNodeMap` — each of which
--   requires decidable equality on `Node` (and, via the auto-derived
--   `DecidableEq (SplitNode Node)` and
--   `DecidableEq (SplitNode (SplitNode Node))` instances inherited
--   from `def_3_11`'s `SplitNode` `inductive`, on the iterated and
--   single-step carriers as well).  Stronger instances (`Fintype`,
--   `LinearOrder`) are not needed at the statement level.
-- claim_3_10 --- start helper
variable {Node : Type*} [DecidableEq Node]
-- claim_3_10 --- end helper

-- ## Helper: well-typedness of the iterated SWIG splitting
--
-- For `W₁ ⊆ G.V`, `W₂ ⊆ G.V` disjoint, `W₂.image .unsplit` sits inside
-- the output-node set of `G.nodeSplittingHard hG W₁ hW₁` —
-- specifically, inside the `(G.V ∖ W₁).image .unsplit` piece by
-- disjointness.  This discharges the `hW` precondition of `def_3_12`'s
-- `nodeSplittingHard` for the *outer* SWIG in
-- `(G_{swig(W₁)})_{swig(W₂)}`.
--
-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Two-piece-union analogue of `claim_3_7`'s
--   `image_unsplit_subset_nodeSplittingOn_V`.*  `def_3_12`'s
--   `V_{swig(W₁)} = (G.V ∖ W₁).image .unsplit ∪ W₁.image .copy0`
--   contains only the `.copy0` (output-side `^o`) tagged copies of
--   `W₁`, with the `.copy1` (input-side `^i`) tagged copies *reclassified
--   to `J_{swig(W₁)}`* (cf.\ `NodeSplittingHard.lean` design bullet on
--   the literal three-piece-union-into-two-piece-union departure from
--   `def_3_11`).  The membership chain is therefore one
--   `Finset.mem_union_left` shorter than the spl analogue — the
--   `W₁.image .copy1` summand simply does not appear, and the proof
--   structure is otherwise identical (case-split on `v ∈ W₂` lifts to
--   `.unsplit v ∈ (G.V ∖ W₁).image .unsplit` via the disjointness
--   `v ∉ W₁`).
--
-- *Implicit `hG : G.IsCADMG` to match `nodeSplittingHard`'s signature.*
--   `def_3_12`'s `nodeSplittingHard` takes
--   `(G) (hG : G.IsCADMG) (W) (hW)` — see `NodeSplittingHard.lean`
--   design bullet (d) for the LN-faithfulness rationale.  The helper
--   carries `hG` as an implicit argument because the conclusion
--   `(G.nodeSplittingHard hG W₁ hW₁).V` mentions `hG` on the
--   `nodeSplittingHard` application (even though the `.V` field itself
--   does not consume `hG`, the type of the membership conclusion does
--   reference `hG` via the function application).  Implicit so call
--   sites elaborate without spelling out `hG` separately when it is
--   already in scope.
--
-- *`Disjoint W₁ W₂`, not `W₂ ⊆ G.V ∖ W₁`.*  Same canonical Mathlib
--   `Finset` shape used in `claim_3_7`'s analogue; `Finset.disjoint_right`
--   consumes / produces this form directly.  The LN's
--   "$W_1 \cap W_2 = \emptyset$" reads as exactly this `Disjoint`.
--
-- *Symmetric in `W₁` / `W₂`.*  Applied as
--   `image_unsplit_subset_nodeSplittingHard_V hW₁ hW₂ hDisj` for the
--   (a) direction (inner SWIG on `W₁`, outer lifts `W₂.image .unsplit`)
--   and as `image_unsplit_subset_nodeSplittingHard_V hW₂ hW₁ hDisj.symm`
--   for the (b) direction (inner SWIG on `W₂`, outer lifts
--   `W₁.image .unsplit`).  A single helper covers both directions; the
--   `Disjoint.symm` rotation does not change the lemma's content.
--
-- *`private`, with helper markers.*  Mirrors the
--   `subset_carrier_of_hardInterventionOn` pattern in
--   `HardInterventionsCommute.lean` (`claim_3_4`) and the
--   `image_unsplit_subset_nodeSplittingOn_V` pattern in
--   `TwoDisjointNode.lean` (`claim_3_7`).  The helper is load-bearing
--   for the main statement to type-check (it supplies the inner-`hW`
--   argument of the outer `nodeSplittingHard`); the website builder
--   pulls it out alongside the rendered statement.  `private`
--   localises it to this file.
--
-- *Scope: discharges only the inner-`hW` precondition.*  Of the two
--   propositional preconditions of the outer `nodeSplittingHard` —
--   `hG : (inner CDMG).IsCADMG` and `hW : (outer W) ⊆ (inner V)` —
--   this helper handles only the second.  The first is the *separately
--   proven* `claim_3_9.swigAcyclic`; the two helpers are complementary
--   and *both* are needed for the iterated SWIG to type-check.  Keeping
--   them as separate named lemmas (rather than a single combined
--   "iterated SWIG is well-typed" predicate) follows the LN's split of
--   "well-typedness" into a `hG`-piece (claim_3_9) and a `hW`-piece
--   (the disjointness consequence); the LN itself never combines them.

-- ref: claim_3_10
--
-- For any CADMG `G` and any two disjoint subsets `W₁, W₂ ⊆ G.V`, the
-- LN's triple equality
--   `(G_{swig(W₁)})_{swig(W₂)} = (G_{swig(W₂)})_{swig(W₁)}
--     = G_{swig(W₁ ∪ W₂)}`
-- decomposes (per the rewritten tex's (a) / (b) split) into two CDMG
-- equalities read up to the canonical flatten map `flattenSplit`
-- imported from `claim_3_7`'s file:
--   (a) `(G_{swig(W₁)})_{swig(W₂)} = G_{swig(W₁ ∪ W₂)}`,
--   (b) `(G_{swig(W₂)})_{swig(W₁)} = G_{swig(W₁ ∪ W₂)}`.
-- Transitivity of equality recovers the LN's "swap symmetry" reading
-- from (a) ∧ (b).

LN tex (rewritten canonical statement for `claim_3_10`):

  Let `G = (J, V, E, L)` be a CDMG and `W₁, W₂ ⊆ V` two subsets of
  the output-node set of `G`, with `W₁ ∩ W₂ = ∅`.  Then
    (a) `(G_{swig(W₁)})_{swig(W₂)} = G_{swig(W₁ ∪ W₂)}`,
    (b) `(G_{swig(W₂)})_{swig(W₁)} = G_{swig(W₁ ∪ W₂)}`,
  read up to the canonical bijection of carriers induced by
  `def_3_12`'s unsplit-injection convention.

LN block (verbatim, for backup):

  Let `G = (J, V, E, L)` be a CADMG and `W_1, W_2 ⊆ V` two disjoint
  subsets of the output nodes from `G`.  Then the CADMG obtained
  from first node-splitting on `W_1` and then node-splitting on `W_2`
  is the same CADMG that arises from first node-splitting on `W_2`
  and then node-splitting on `W_1`:
    `(G_{swig(W_1)})_{swig(W_2)} = (G_{swig(W_2)})_{swig(W_1)}
       = G_{swig(W_1 ⊍ W_2)}`.

(The "CADMG" wording in the LN's prose is reconciled with the Lean
`CDMG`-typed signature via the canonical tex's "Reading of CDMG
versus CADMG" paragraph: `def_3_12`'s `nodeSplittingHard` is
`CDMG → CDMG`, and the upgrade of both sides to `CADMG` is recovered
by transporting `claim_3_9`'s `swigAcyclic` witness along the
asserted CDMG equality.)

-- ## Design choice
--
-- *One theorem returning a conjunction `(a) ∧ (b)`, with the
--   joint-intervention `G_{swig(W₁ ∪ W₂)}` as the shared right-hand
--   side.*  Lean has no native triple equality; the rewritten tex's
--   `enumerate[label=(\alph*)]` block makes the two-binary-equality
--   decomposition load-bearing.  The same conjunction shape appears
--   in `HardInterventionsCommute` (claim_3_4) and in the regular-spl
--   sibling `TwoDisjointNode` (claim_3_7); reusing the pattern keeps
--   all three "commute" rows callable at parallel `.1` / `.2`
--   projections.  The LN's swap-symmetry reading
--   `(G_{swig(W₁)})_{swig(W₂)} = (G_{swig(W₂)})_{swig(W₁)}` is
--   recovered from (a) ∧ (b) via transitivity through the shared
--   right-hand side.
--
-- *Why the LHS-equals-RHS form `eqViaNodeMap iter single flattenSplit`,
--   not `eqViaNodeMap iter₁₂ iter₂₁ (refl)` or any other "direct"
--   equality between the two iterated forms.*  At the Lean level,
--   `iter₁₂ := (G.nodeSplittingHard hG W₁ hW₁).nodeSplittingHard _
--   (W₂.image .unsplit) _` and `iter₂₁ := (G.nodeSplittingHard hG W₂ hW₂).nodeSplittingHard
--   _ (W₁.image .unsplit) _` share the carrier type
--   `SplitNode (SplitNode Node)`, but their constructor wrappings on
--   the same underlying graph node disagree: a node `w₁ ∈ W₁`
--   appears as `.unsplit (.copy0 w₁)` in `iter₁₂`'s `V` field but as
--   `.copy0 (.unsplit w₁)` in `iter₂₁`'s `V` field (and analogously a
--   node `w₁ ∈ W₁` appears as `.unsplit (.copy1 w₁)` in `iter₁₂`'s
--   `J` field but as `.copy1 (.unsplit w₁)` in `iter₂₁`'s `J` field).
--   A literal `iter₁₂ = iter₂₁` is therefore *false* as a Lean
--   proposition — the four `Finset` fields contain different
--   constructor combinations even though they describe the same
--   abstract graph.  Routing both sides through the canonical
--   single-step `G_{swig(W₁ ∪ W₂)}` via the *same* `flattenSplit`
--   image-level relabelling is the mathematically faithful encoding;
--   swap symmetry between `iter₁₂` and `iter₂₁` is then recovered as
--   the transitive composite `eqViaNodeMap iter₁₂ single flattenSplit
--   ∧ eqViaNodeMap iter₂₁ single flattenSplit`, not as a raw `=`.
--   Identical reasoning underlies `claim_3_7`'s `TwoDisjointNode`
--   statement; we reuse the same encoding.
--
-- *Reuse `flattenSplit` and `eqViaNodeMap` from `claim_3_7`'s solved
--   file.*  Both definitions are purely constructor-algebra and
--   operate on the shared `SplitNode (SplitNode Node)` carrier
--   regardless of which of `def_3_11` / `def_3_12` produced the
--   nested splitting.  The cases that actually inhabit `iter₁₂`'s
--   carrier (and `iter₂₁`'s) under `def_3_12` are a *subset* of the
--   cases that inhabit them under `def_3_11` — specifically, the
--   `.unsplit (.copy1 _)` / `.copy1 (.unsplit _)` patterns appear in
--   the `J` fields (not the `V` fields) of the SWIG, but `flattenSplit`
--   collapses them identically — so the same flatten map handles both
--   the spl and SWIG iterated forms.  See the file header for the
--   "Reuse from `claim_3_7`'s solved file" paragraph and the
--   `claim_3_7` design block for `flattenSplit` / `eqViaNodeMap`'s
--   own design rationale (function-not-Equiv, four-conjunct
--   componentwise equality, image-level reasoning under a non-bijective
--   carrier function).
--
-- *Disjoint-union encoding: `W₁ ∪ W₂` together with `Disjoint W₁ W₂`,
--   not `Sum`-based `⊔`.*  Matches `def_3_12`'s `nodeSplittingHard` API,
--   which takes `W : Finset Node` and `hW : W ⊆ G.V` — so the natural
--   right-hand side is `G.nodeSplittingHard hG (W₁ ∪ W₂)
--   (Finset.union_subset hW₁ hW₂)`.  The `Disjoint W₁ W₂` hypothesis
--   (Mathlib's `Finset.Disjoint`, i.e.\ intersection-empty on
--   `Finset`) is load-bearing for the well-typedness of the iterated
--   splitting — the inner-`hW` proof
--   `image_unsplit_subset_nodeSplittingHard_V` consumes it, per the
--   rewritten tex's "Well-typedness of the iterated SWIG" paragraph.
--   It plays well with `Finset.union_subset` for the right-hand side
--   hypothesis `W₁ ∪ W₂ ⊆ G.V`, with no `Finset.disjUnion` coercion
--   gymnastics needed.  The LN's "$W_1 \cap W_2 = \emptyset$" reads
--   as exactly this `Disjoint`; matches `claim_3_7`'s choice exactly.
--
-- *`(G : CDMG Node) (hG : G.IsCADMG)` split rather than a bundled
--   `CADMG` structure.*  Section 3.1 (`def_3_7`) introduces CADMG as the
--   propositional predicate `IsCADMG : CDMG Node → Prop` (definitionally
--   `IsAcyclic`) on top of the existing `CDMG` `structure`, *not* as a
--   bundled subtype `{G : CDMG Node // G.IsAcyclic}` — see
--   `NodeSplittingHard.lean` design bullet (d) for the chapter-wide
--   rationale.  This row inherits that convention: `G` carries the
--   `CDMG` data, `hG` carries the acyclicity witness as a separate
--   `Prop`-valued argument, and `nodeSplittingHard` consumes the pair.
--   Bundling would force the LN's plain "$G$" identifier to be an
--   awkward `.val`-projection at every reference; the unbundled shape
--   keeps the asserted equality between two CDMGs (not CADMGs) at
--   exactly the form the LN writes.
--
-- *`swigAcyclic G hG Wᵢ hWᵢ` (= `claim_3_9`) feeds the *outer*
--   iterated SWIG's `hG` slot.*  The iterated form
--   `(G.nodeSplittingHard hG W₁ hW₁).nodeSplittingHard ?_ (W₂.image
--   .unsplit) ?_` demands an `IsCADMG` witness on the inner CDMG —
--   *this is non-trivial* and is precisely the content of
--   `claim_3_9.swigAcyclic`: `(G.nodeSplittingHard hG W hW).IsAcyclic`.
--   The definitional unfolding `IsCADMG := IsAcyclic` (def_3_7 item i)
--   lets this `IsAcyclic` witness be supplied directly where an
--   `IsCADMG` argument is expected, with no manual coercion.  Without
--   claim_3_9 the iterated SWIG would not type-check at all (Manager A
--   ordered claim_3_9 before claim_3_10 specifically to discharge this
--   dependency).  The same `swigAcyclic G hG Wᵢ hWᵢ` plumbing
--   construction is the canonical pattern any later row needing
--   iterated / nested SWIGs (e.g.\ proofs in the do-calculus and
--   counterfactual chapters) will reuse.
--
-- *Result is a CDMG (`eqViaNodeMap` on `CDMG (SplitNode (SplitNode Node))`
--   and `CDMG (SplitNode Node)`), not a CADMG.*  Per the canonical
--   tex's "Reading of CDMG versus CADMG" paragraph and the chapter
--   pattern: `nodeSplittingHard` returns `CDMG`, the CADMG upgrade is
--   carried by `claim_3_9`'s `swigAcyclic` separately, and the
--   asserted equality is read at the CDMG level componentwise on the
--   four `Finset` data fields.  Both iterated and single-step graphs
--   inhabit `CDMG (SplitNode _)` (with the iterated form at
--   `SplitNode (SplitNode Node)` and the single-step form at
--   `SplitNode Node`); no `CADMG` wrapper appears anywhere in the
--   signature, in line with `claim_3_7`'s analogous choice.
--
-- *Carrier-mismatch wrinkle handled via `eqViaNodeMap` + `flattenSplit`.*
--   See the module-level docstring "Carrier-mismatch wrinkle" paragraph.
--   The LN's "equality of CDMGs read up to the canonical bijection of
--   carriers" is rendered as `eqViaNodeMap iterated single flattenSplit`:
--   the four `Finset` data fields of the iterated splitting, after
--   applying `flattenSplit` field-wise, coincide with the four data
--   fields of the single splitting.  This is the strongest equality
--   form available without introducing quotient types or a `CDMG.Iso`
--   layer.  Same encoding as `claim_3_7`.
--
-- ## Known limitations of the chosen shape
--
-- *Image-level, not type-level, identification.*  `eqViaNodeMap`
--   asserts equality of the four `Finset` data fields under
--   `Finset.image flattenSplit`; it does *not* exhibit a type-level
--   bijection between `CDMG (SplitNode (SplitNode Node))` and
--   `CDMG (SplitNode Node)` (no such bijection exists — see the
--   `flattenSplit` design block in `TwoDisjointNode.lean`).  A consumer
--   that needs to *transport* a separate property from the iterated to
--   the single form (e.g.\ "every node in the iterated SWIG has parents
--   in the single SWIG") would need an additional lemma threading the
--   image-level equality through the property; this row delivers only
--   the four `Finset` equalities, not a general transport principle.
--
-- *No `CADMG`-level upgrade of the equality.*  This theorem lives at
--   the CDMG level.  A downstream consumer wanting "the two SWIGs are
--   equal *as CADMGs*" must compose this statement with `claim_3_9`'s
--   `swigAcyclic` on each side — there is no single combined lemma.
--   Acceptable because the CADMG status is a `Prop`-valued predicate
--   uniquely determined by the underlying CDMG data, so the image-level
--   CDMG equality plus the two `swigAcyclic` applications recover the
--   CADMG-level reading without ambiguity.
--
-- *Swap symmetry `iter₁₂ ↔ iter₂₁` is derived, not stated.*  The LN's
--   reading "first $W_1$ then $W_2$ equals first $W_2$ then $W_1$"
--   becomes the transitive composite of (a) and (b), not a third
--   `eqViaNodeMap iter₁₂ iter₂₁ id` conjunct (which would not type-check
--   because the two iterated carriers, though sharing the type
--   `SplitNode (SplitNode Node)`, contain different constructor
--   combinations on the same underlying node — see the LHS-equals-RHS
--   bullet above).  Consumers wanting the swap reading apply
--   transitivity on the conjunction.

--
-- The two `REFACTOR-BLOCK-REPLACEMENT` blocks below port the

-- `L : Finset (Sym2 Node)`; `nodeSplittingHard` with

-- Refactor port of `image_unsplit_subset_nodeSplittingHard_V` for
-- the `cdmg_typed_edges` design.  Statement and proof are
-- structurally identical to the original; only the type carrier
-- (`CDMG → CDMG`), the splitting operation
-- (`nodeSplittingHard → nodeSplittingHard`), the
-- acyclicity predicate (`IsCADMG → IsCADMG`), and the
-- unsplit-injection constructor
-- (`SplitNode.unsplit → SplitNode.unsplit`) change.  The
-- proof body uses the same `Finset.mem_sdiff` /
-- `Finset.disjoint_right` machinery — the V-side of
-- `nodeSplittingHard` is structurally identical to the
-- pre-refactor `nodeSplittingHard`'s V-side (refactor changes
-- only the L-channel), so the lemma carries over verbatim with
-- only the rename pass.

--
-- Refactor port of `twoDisjointNodeSplittingHardCommute` for the
-- `cdmg_typed_edges` design.  Same statement structure as the
-- original — a conjunction `(a) ∧ (b)` of two
-- `eqViaNodeMap` equalities through the shared joint SWIG
-- `G_{swig(W₁ ∪ W₂)}` — and the same eight sub-goals (J, V, E, L
-- for each iteration order).
--
-- ## Refactor port — proof structure
--
-- * **J / V / E sub-goals (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) port mechanically.**
--   The tactic blocks are verbatim from the original up to the
--   rename pass `SplitNode → SplitNode`,
--   `toCopy0 → toCopy0`, `toCopy1 → toCopy1`,
--   helper-name `flatten_toCopy0_toCopy0 →
--   flatten_refactor_toCopy0_refactor_toCopy0`, etc.  The
--   structural reason this works is that
--   `nodeSplittingHard`'s J / V / E fields are unchanged
--   from `nodeSplittingHard`'s (the refactor changes only the L
--   side); every `change`-target, every `Finset.image_image`
--   fusion, every `Finset.image_congr` pointwise check has the
--   same shape after the rename.
--
-- * **L sub-goals (4 and 8) are structurally reworked for
--   `Sym2.map`.**  The original L-side threaded the lift through
--   `Prod.map flattenSplit flattenSplit` on ordered pairs; the
--   refactor threads it through `Sym2.map flattenSplit`
--   on the `Sym2`-quotient.  The double-image fuses via
--   `Finset.image_image` exactly as before, but the inner
--   map-composition `Sym2.map f ∘ Sym2.map g` fuses (now) to
--   `Sym2.map (f ∘ g)` via Mathlib's `Sym2.map_map`.  The
--   pointwise close uses the inline helper
--   `flatten_refactor_toCopy0_refactor_toCopy0` (verbatim port of
--   `flatten_toCopy0_toCopy0`, all branches unchanged because the
--   tagged-sum carrier `SplitNode` is structurally the
--   same as the pre-refactor `SplitNode`).
--
-- * **Inline `have`-locals match the original's style.**  Per the
--   manager.md "Net-new helpers also need REPLACEMENT markers"
--   guidance: prefer inline `have`-locals over hoisted top-level
--   declarations.  The original `twoDisjointNodeSplittingHardCommute`
--   keeps `flatten_toCopy0_toCopy0` / `flatten_toCopy1_toCopy1`
--   inline; we do the same with the `refactor_`-prefixed twins.
