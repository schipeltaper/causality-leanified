# Two disjoint node-splittings commute (`claim_3_7`)

This file formalises the LN lemma `claim_3_7` (`TwoDisjointNode`) in
section 3.2 of `graphs.tex`:

> Let `G = (J, V, E, L)` be a CDMG and `W₁, W₂ ⊆ V` two disjoint subsets
> of the output nodes.  Then
> `(G_{spl(W₁)})_{spl(W₂)} = (G_{spl(W₂)})_{spl(W₁)} = G_{spl(W₁ ∪ W₂)}`.

The authoritative spec is the rewritten canonical tex statement at
`leanification/Chapter3_GraphTheory/Section3_2/tex/claim_3_7_statement_TwoDisjointNode.tex`,
verified equivalent to the LN block plus the `cdmg_vs_cadmg_terminology_mismatch`
addition_to_the_LN (which corrects the LN's mid-sentence "CADMG" typo to
"CDMG": `nodeSplittingOn` is `CDMG → CDMG` and the asserted equality is
an equality of CDMGs).

The rewritten tex decomposes the LN's triple equality into the
conjunction of two binary equalities, matching the `claim_3_4`
(`HardInterventionsCommute`) pattern:

* (a) `(G_{spl(W₁)})_{spl(W₂)} = G_{spl(W₁ ∪ W₂)}`
* (b) `(G_{spl(W₂)})_{spl(W₁)} = G_{spl(W₁ ∪ W₂)}`

Transitivity of equality recovers the LN's "swap symmetry" reading
`(G_{spl(W₁)})_{spl(W₂)} = (G_{spl(W₂)})_{spl(W₁)}` from (a) ∧ (b).

## Carrier-mismatch wrinkle (load-bearing for this row's Lean signature)

`def_3_11`'s `nodeSplittingOn` changes the node carrier
(`CDMG α → CDMG (SplitNode α)`), so the iterated splitting
`(G.nodeSplittingOn W₁ _).nodeSplittingOn (W₂.image .unsplit) _` lives
in `CDMG (SplitNode (SplitNode Node))` — a formally distinct type from
the single splitting `G.nodeSplittingOn (W₁ ∪ W₂) _ : CDMG (SplitNode
Node)`.  The LN identifies the two carriers set-theoretically via
`def_3_11`'s unsplit-injection convention "`v⁰ := v¹ := v` for
`v ∈ J ∪ (V ∖ W)`"; the rewritten tex's "Equality up to the canonical
bijection of carriers" paragraph spells this out.  This Lean rendering
captures the identification via the canonical flatten function
`flattenSplit : SplitNode (SplitNode Node) → SplitNode Node` (defined
below); the LN's "equality of CDMGs" reading becomes "the four `Finset`
data fields of the iterated splitting, after applying `flattenSplit`
field-wise, coincide with the four `Finset` data fields of the single
splitting", packaged as the helper predicate `eqViaNodeMap`.

This row is the first in chapter 3 hitting the carrier-mismatch
wrinkle (`nodeSplittingOn` changing the node type from `α` to
`SplitNode α`).  The same `flattenSplit` / `eqViaNodeMap` encoding
pattern extends to any chapter row that iterates node-splitting or
composes node-splitting with hard intervention.

The body is filled in by `prove_claim_in_lean` (Manager B), following
the to-be-written tex proof at
`tex/claim_3_7_proof_TwoDisjointNode.tex`.

-- `Node : Type*` with `[DecidableEq Node]`.  Inherited from `def_3_1`
-- (`CDMG.lean`); load-bearing because the statement constructs
-- `W₁ ∪ W₂` (needs `Finset.union`), `W₂.image SplitNode.unsplit`
-- (needs `Finset.image`), and four `Finset.image f` equalities
-- inside `eqViaNodeMap` — every one of which requires decidable
-- equality on `Node` (and, via the auto-derived
-- `DecidableEq (SplitNode Node)` and
-- `DecidableEq (SplitNode (SplitNode Node))` instances from
-- `def_3_11`, on the iterated and single-step carriers as well).
-- Stronger instances (`Fintype`, `LinearOrder`) are not needed at the
-- statement level and are deferred to the proof body's use sites.

-- ## Helper: the canonical flatten map `SplitNode (SplitNode Node) → SplitNode Node`
--
-- Realises the LN's "canonical bijection of carriers" induced by
-- `def_3_11`'s unsplit-injection convention `v⁰ := v¹ := v` for
-- `v ∈ J ∪ (V ∖ W)`.  On the *iterated* carrier (the elements that
-- actually inhabit `(G_{spl(W₁)})_{spl(W₂)}.V`):
--
--   .unsplit (.unsplit v) ↦ .unsplit v   (v ∈ J ∪ (V ∖ (W₁ ∪ W₂)))
--   .unsplit (.copy0 w)   ↦ .copy0 w     (w ∈ W₁; inner-split copy)
--   .unsplit (.copy1 w)   ↦ .copy1 w     (w ∈ W₁; inner-split copy)
--   .copy0 (.unsplit w)   ↦ .copy0 w     (w ∈ W₂; outer-split copy)
--   .copy1 (.unsplit w)   ↦ .copy1 w     (w ∈ W₂; outer-split copy)
--
-- The off-carrier cases (`.copy0 (.copy0 _)`, etc.) never appear in the
-- iterated carrier when `Disjoint W₁ W₂`; the values below are filled
-- in for totality of the pattern match and do not affect the equality
-- this row asserts.
--
-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Function, not `Equiv` of types.*  A type-level `SplitNode (SplitNode
--   Node) ≃ SplitNode Node` does not exist: when `Node` is non-empty
--   the source has nine reachable constructor combinations per node
--   and the target only three, so no bijection on the underlying
--   types is possible.  `flattenSplit` is instead injective only when
--   restricted to the *iterated carrier*
--   `((G.V ∖ W₁) ⊍ W₁⁰ ⊍ W₁¹) ⊍ ((W₂ image .unsplit)⁰) ⊍ …`,
--   and the disjointness hypothesis `Disjoint W₁ W₂` is precisely
--   what makes that restricted injection well-defined (without it,
--   `.copy0 (.unsplit w)` and `.copy0 (.copy0 w)` could both lie in
--   the carrier and would both map to `.copy0 w`).  Image-level
--   reasoning via `Finset.image flattenSplit` is enough for the
--   statement; the proof of the main theorem will only ever apply
--   `flattenSplit` to elements actually in the iterated carrier.
--
-- *Total pattern match on `SplitNode (SplitNode Node)`.*  Lean requires
--   total functions; the off-carrier cases (`.copy0 (.copy0 _)`,
--   `.copy0 (.copy1 _)`, `.copy1 (.copy0 _)`, `.copy1 (.copy1 _)`)
--   are filled in with the simplest value that keeps the pattern
--   match exhaustive.  Their values do not affect the equality this
--   row asserts, because `Finset.image` over the iterated carrier
--   never reaches them.  An alternative — partial functions over
--   `Subtype` of the iterated carrier — was rejected because every
--   downstream `Finset.image` call would then need a subtype-respecting
--   wrapper, ballooning the four field-equalities in `eqViaNodeMap`.
--
-- *Same `flattenSplit` for the (a) and (b) directions.*  The
--   case-analysis above is symmetric in `W₁` / `W₂`: the constructors
--   `unsplit` / `copy0` / `copy1` are blind to which `Wᵢ` the
--   underlying node belongs to, so the same flatten map handles both
--   iteration orders.  This is the reason a single
--   `flattenSplit` (rather than an asymmetric pair `flattenSplit₁₂` /
--   `flattenSplit₂₁`) is enough; without this symmetry the statement
--   would need two distinct flatten maps and the conjunction shape
--   `(a) ∧ (b)` would not be symmetric in its proof witnesses.
--
-- *Mathlib re-use.*  Rolled our own — Mathlib carries no general
--   "flatten nested tagged sum" map specific to the `unsplit / copy0 /
--   copy1` triple of `def_3_11`.  A `Sum`-based encoding of `SplitNode`
--   would let us reuse `Sum.elim`, but the case-analysis would not
--   shorten; only the names of the constructors would change.

-- ## Helper: equality of two CDMGs (over possibly different carriers) via a node map
--
-- The four data fields `(J, V, E, L)` of a CDMG are `Finset`s.  Given
-- a node map `f : α → β`, `eqViaNodeMap G G' f` asserts that the image
-- of `G`'s four data fields under `f` (with `Prod.map f f` on the edge
-- sets) coincides with `G'`'s four data fields.  This captures the
-- LN's "equality of CDMGs read up to the canonical bijection of
-- carriers": when `f` is the canonical bijection on the carriers
-- (here `flattenSplit`), the predicate holds iff the two CDMGs
-- describe the same graph after identifying nodes via `f`.
--
-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Strongest Lean reading of "equality of CDMGs up to a canonical
--   carrier relabelling" without quotient types.*  Literal `=` between
--   `G` and `G'` is not type-correct when their carriers differ; an
--   `Equiv`-of-CDMGs / `CDMG.Iso` layer would require the carrier map
--   to be a type-level bijection, which `flattenSplit` is not (see the
--   `flattenSplit` block above).  Quotienting both carriers by a
--   common identification would discharge the type-mismatch but is
--   overkill for an equality read componentwise on `Finset`s; the LN
--   never invokes such a quotient.  `eqViaNodeMap` instead asserts the
--   image-level equality of the four data fields under `f`, which is
--   the literal componentwise reading the LN's "the same CDMG" intends
--   (the `def_3_11` notational shorthand `v⁰ := v¹ := v` is precisely
--   the carrier-level identification that `flattenSplit` realises).
--
-- *`Prop`-valued helper, not a `def CDMG.mapNodes` returning `CDMG β`.*
--   A data-valued transport would require discharging the five
--   propositional CDMG axioms (`hJV_disj`, `hE_subset`, `hL_subset`,
--   `hL_irrefl`, `hL_symm`) under the image, with an
--   injectivity-on-the-carrier hypothesis on `f` to lift `Disjoint J
--   V` and `hL_irrefl` through.  The `Prop`-valued form sidesteps both
--   costs: the four field equalities are plain `Finset` equalities,
--   and well-formedness of `G'` is automatic (it is supplied as
--   input, not constructed from `G` and `f`).  Trade-off:
--   `eqViaNodeMap` does not bundle a "mapped" CDMG, so downstream
--   consumers wanting to apply further constructions to the
--   transported graph would need to either prove well-formedness ad
--   hoc or upgrade to a data-valued `mapNodes`.  The current row only
--   needs the equality reading.
--
-- *Four conjuncts, mirroring `CDMG`'s four data fields.*  Consumers
--   destructure via `.1` / `.2.1` / `.2.2.1` / `.2.2.2`.  A bundled
--   `structure` would add a layer of named-field projection without
--   changing content; the four `Finset` equalities are exactly the
--   data part of `def_3_1`, so the conjunctive shape is the natural
--   "componentwise" reading.
--
-- *Mathlib re-use.*  Rolled our own.  Mathlib's `Equiv` / `Iso`
--   abstractions assume a two-sided invertible carrier map (or a
--   morphism-and-inverse pair); neither shape fits a one-directional
--   image equality under a non-bijective carrier function.

-- ## Helper: well-typedness of the iterated splitting
--
-- For `W₁ ⊆ G.V`, `W₂ ⊆ G.V` disjoint, `W₂.image .unsplit` sits inside
-- the output-node set of `G.nodeSplittingOn W₁ hW₁` — specifically,
-- inside the `(G.V ∖ W₁).image .unsplit` piece, by disjointness.  This
-- discharges the `hW` precondition of `def_3_11`'s `nodeSplittingOn`
-- for the *outer* splitting in `(G_{spl(W₁)})_{spl(W₂)}`.
--
-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Lift via `Finset.image SplitNode.unsplit`, not via a fresh `Finset`
--   on the iterated carrier.*  The `unsplit` constructor of
--   `def_3_11`'s `SplitNode` is the type-level realisation of the LN's
--   "$v \in J \cup (V \sm W)$ stays in the carrier as itself" — so
--   `.image SplitNode.unsplit` *tags each `w ∈ W₂` as a node that the
--   inner splitting on `W₁` left alone*.  The disjointness
--   `Disjoint W₁ W₂` is exactly what guarantees that this tagging is
--   compatible with `def_3_11`'s output: `nodeSplittingOn` of `W₁`
--   removes `W₁` from the output carrier (`(V ∖ W₁).image .unsplit`)
--   and creates the new `W₁⁰`, `W₁¹` copies separately, so a `w ∈ W₂`
--   with `w ∉ W₁` lands in the `(V ∖ W₁).image .unsplit` piece via
--   `.unsplit w`.
--
-- *Disjointness `Disjoint W₁ W₂`, not the weaker `W₂ ⊆ G.V ∖ W₁` or
--   the stronger `W₁ ∩ W₂ = ∅` rewritten as `Finset.inter_eq_empty`.*
--   `Disjoint W₁ W₂` is the canonical Mathlib `Finset` shape
--   (intersection-empty) and lets the helper consume / produce
--   `Finset.disjoint_right` (and similar) directly; the LN's
--   "$W_1 \cap W_2 = \emptyset$" reads as exactly this `Disjoint`.
--   `W₂ ⊆ G.V ∖ W₁` would force the consumer to derive disjointness
--   from a subset, an extra rewrite at every call site.
--
-- *`private`, with helper markers.*  Mirrors the
--   `subset_carrier_of_hardInterventionOn` pattern in
--   `HardInterventionsCommute.lean` (`claim_3_4`).  The helper is
--   load-bearing for the statement to type-check (it supplies the
--   inner `hW` argument of `nodeSplittingOn`), so it carries helper
--   markers; the website builder pulls it out alongside the rendered
--   statement.  `private` localises it to this file; downstream
--   carrier-mismatch rows can re-introduce the same pattern locally
--   rather than reaching across files.
--
-- *Symmetric in `W₁` / `W₂`: applied as
--   `image_unsplit_subset_nodeSplittingOn_V hW₁ hW₂ hDisj` for the (a)
--   direction and as
--   `image_unsplit_subset_nodeSplittingOn_V hW₂ hW₁ hDisj.symm`
--   for the (b) direction.*  A single helper covers both; splitting
--   into two named lemmas would duplicate the proof.

LN tex (rewritten canonical statement for `claim_3_7`):

  Let `G = (J, V, E, L)` be a CDMG and `W₁, W₂ ⊆ V` two subsets of
  the output-node set of `G`, with `W₁ ∩ W₂ = ∅`.  Then
    (a) `(G_{spl(W₁)})_{spl(W₂)} = G_{spl(W₁ ∪ W₂)}`,
    (b) `(G_{spl(W₂)})_{spl(W₁)} = G_{spl(W₁ ∪ W₂)}`,
  read up to the canonical bijection of carriers induced by
  `def_3_11`'s unsplit-injection convention.

LN block (verbatim, for backup):

  Let `G = (J, V, E, L)` be a CDMG and `W_1, W_2 ⊆ V` two disjoint
  subsets of the output nodes of `G`.  Then the CDMG obtained from
  first node-splitting `W_1` and then node-splitting `W_2` is the
  same CADMG that arises from first node-splitting `W_2` and then
  node-splitting `W_1`:
    `(G_{spl(W_1)})_{spl(W_2)} = (G_{spl(W_2)})_{spl(W_1)}
       = G_{spl(W_1 ∪ W_2)}`.

(The mid-sentence "CADMG" is a typo for "CDMG" per the
`cdmg_vs_cadmg_terminology_mismatch` addition_to_the_LN; the
equality is an equality of CDMGs.)

-- ## Design choice
--
-- *One theorem returning a conjunction `(a) ∧ (b)`, with the
--   joint-intervention `G_{spl(W₁ ∪ W₂)}` as the shared right-hand
--   side.*  Lean has no native triple equality; the rewritten tex's
--   `enumerate[label=(\alph*)]` block makes the two-binary-equality
--   decomposition load-bearing.  The same conjunction shape appears
--   in `HardInterventionsCommute` (claim_3_4); reusing the pattern
--   here keeps the two "commute" rows callable at parallel `.1` /
--   `.2` projections.  The LN's swap-symmetry reading
--   `(G_{spl(W₁)})_{spl(W₂)} = (G_{spl(W₂)})_{spl(W₁)}` is recovered
--   from (a) ∧ (b) via transitivity through the shared right-hand
--   side.
--
-- *Why the LHS-equals-RHS form `eqViaNodeMap iter single flattenSplit`,
--   not `eqViaNodeMap iter₁₂ iter₂₁ (refl)` or any other "direct"
--   equality between the two iterated forms.*  At the Lean level,
--   `iter₁₂ := (G.nodeSplittingOn W₁ _).nodeSplittingOn (W₂.image
--   .unsplit) _` and `iter₂₁ := (G.nodeSplittingOn W₂ _).nodeSplittingOn
--   (W₁.image .unsplit) _` have the same carrier type
--   `SplitNode (SplitNode Node)`, but the *constructor wrappings* of
--   the same underlying graph node disagree: a node `w₁ ∈ W₁`
--   appears as `.unsplit (.copy0 w₁)` in `iter₁₂`'s carrier (since
--   `W₁` is split first, producing `.copy0 w₁ : SplitNode Node`, then
--   wrapped under `.unsplit` by the outer splitting on
--   `W₂.image .unsplit`) but as `.copy0 (.unsplit w₁)` in `iter₂₁`'s
--   carrier (since `W₁` is now split *second*, after `W₂` produced
--   a `SplitNode Node` carrier in which `w₁` was tagged `.unsplit`).
--   A literal `iter₁₂ = iter₂₁` is therefore *false* as a Lean
--   proposition — the four `Finset` fields contain different
--   constructor combinations even though they describe the same
--   abstract graph.  Routing both sides through the canonical
--   single-step `G_{spl(W₁ ∪ W₂)}` via the *same* `flattenSplit`
--   image-level relabelling is the mathematically faithful encoding;
--   "swap symmetry" between `iter₁₂` and `iter₂₁` is then recovered
--   as the transitive composite `eqViaNodeMap iter₁₂ single
--   flattenSplit ∧ eqViaNodeMap iter₂₁ single flattenSplit`, not as a
--   raw `=`.
--
-- *Disjoint-union encoding: `W₁ ∪ W₂` together with `Disjoint W₁ W₂`,
--   not `Sum`-based `⊔`.*  Matches `def_3_11`'s `nodeSplittingOn` API,
--   which takes `W : Finset Node` and `hW : W ⊆ G.V` — so the natural
--   right-hand side is `G.nodeSplittingOn (W₁ ∪ W₂) (Finset.union_subset
--   hW₁ hW₂)`.  The `Disjoint W₁ W₂` hypothesis (Mathlib's
--   `Finset.Disjoint`, i.e.\ intersection-empty on `Finset`) is
--   load-bearing for the well-typedness of the iterated splitting
--   (the inner-`hW` proof `image_unsplit_subset_nodeSplittingOn_V`
--   consumes it), per the rewritten tex's "Well-typedness of the
--   iterated splitting" paragraph.  It plays well with
--   `Finset.union_subset` for the right-hand side hypothesis
--   `W₁ ∪ W₂ ⊆ V`, with no `Finset.disjUnion` coercion gymnastics
--   needed.  Encoding the LN's "$W_1 \cap W_2 = \emptyset$" as the raw
--   `W₁ ∩ W₂ = ∅` was an alternative; the `Disjoint`-formulation is
--   chosen because `def_3_11`-driven side conditions (which this
--   helper discharges by case-splitting via `Finset.disjoint_right`)
--   live more naturally in the `Disjoint` API.
--
-- *Result is a CDMG, not a CADMG.*  Per the `addition_to_the_LN`
--   `cdmg_vs_cadmg_terminology_mismatch`: the LN's mid-sentence drift
--   "the CDMG\ldots is the same CADMG\ldots" is a typographical
--   inconsistency, not a genuine change of category.
--   `nodeSplittingOn` is `CDMG → CDMG` (it can introduce 2-cycles
--   when `G` has self-loops on `W`, so the result is in general not
--   acyclic).  Both sides of the asserted equality live in
--   `CDMG (SplitNode _)`; no `CADMG` wrapper appears anywhere in the
--   signature.
--
-- *Carrier-mismatch wrinkle handled via `eqViaNodeMap` + `flattenSplit`.*
--   See the module-level docstring and the helper blocks above.  The
--   LN's "equality of CDMGs read up to the canonical bijection of
--   carriers" is rendered as `eqViaNodeMap iterated single
--   flattenSplit`: the four `Finset` data fields of the iterated
--   splitting, after applying `flattenSplit` field-wise, coincide
--   with the four data fields of the single splitting.  This is the
--   strongest equality form available without introducing quotient
--   types or a `CDMG.Iso` layer.

-- ## Refactor port — REPLACEMENT blocks for the `cdmg_typed_edges` design
--
-- The five `REFACTOR-BLOCK-REPLACEMENT` blocks below port the
-- pre-refactor declarations in this file to the post-refactor
-- `def_3_1` / `def_3_11` shapes (`refactor_CDMG` with
-- `L : Finset (Sym2 Node)`; `refactor_nodeSplittingOn` with
-- `L := G.L.image (Sym2.map (refactor_toCopy0 W))`).  Each block
-- mirrors its ORIGINAL above with the prefix `refactor_` and the
-- type / operation substitutions:
--
--   * `CDMG → refactor_CDMG`
--   * `SplitNode → refactor_SplitNode`
--   * `toCopy0 / toCopy1 → refactor_toCopy0 / refactor_toCopy1`
--   * `nodeSplittingOn → refactor_nodeSplittingOn`
--   * `flattenSplit / eqViaNodeMap / image_unsplit_subset_…` →
--     same with the `refactor_` prefix
--
-- The J/V/E sides of the main theorem port mechanically — same
-- tactics, just renames.  Only the L-side (sub-goals 4 and 8) is
-- structurally reworked, because `L`'s storage changed from
-- ordered pairs (`Prod.map f f`) to `Sym2`-quotient
-- unordered pairs (`Sym2.map f`).  The rework uses Mathlib's
-- `Sym2.map_map` (`Sym2.map g (Sym2.map f x) = Sym2.map (g ∘ f) x`)
-- to fuse the two-stage tagged-sum lift back into a single-stage
-- one, then closes pointwise via `Sym2.map_congr` and the inline
-- `flatten_refactor_toCopy0_refactor_toCopy0` helper (verbatim port
-- of the original `flatten_toCopy0_toCopy0`).

-- (`def_3_11` post-refactor) has the same three named constructors
-- `unsplit / copy0 / copy1` as the pre-refactor `SplitNode` — the
-- refactor changes only the L-side of `def_3_1` / `def_3_11`, not
-- the tagged-sum carrier of the split-graph node universe.
-- See the design block above the original `flattenSplit` for the
-- substantive design rationale (function-not-`Equiv`, total

-- `def_3_1` shape `L : Finset (Sym2 Node)`, the per-element lift
-- along `f : α → β` is `Sym2.map f : Sym2 α → Sym2 β` (the action
-- of `f` on the `Sym2`-quotient `(Node × Node) / swap`), not the
-- Cartesian `Prod.map f f`.
--
-- See the design block above the original `eqViaNodeMap` for the
-- substantive design rationale (`Prop`-valued helper, four
-- conjuncts mirroring `CDMG`'s four data fields, image-level
-- reading of the LN's "equality up to the canonical bijection of
-- carriers").  Only the L-conjunct's typing changes; the
-- conjunctive shape, the use of `Finset.image` over four data

-- ref: claim_3_7
--
-- Refactor port of `twoDisjointNodeSplittingsCommute` for the
-- `cdmg_typed_edges` design.  Same statement structure as the
-- original — a conjunction `(a) ∧ (b)` of two
-- `refactor_eqViaNodeMap` equalities through the shared joint
-- intervention `G_{spl(W₁ ∪ W₂)}` — and the same eight
-- sub-goals (J, V, E, L for each iteration order).
--
-- ## Refactor port — proof structure
--
-- * **J / V / E sub-goals (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) port mechanically.**
--   The tactic blocks are verbatim from the original up to the
--   rename pass `SplitNode → refactor_SplitNode`,
--   `toCopy0 → refactor_toCopy0`, `toCopy1 → refactor_toCopy1`,
--   helper-name `flatten_toCopy0_toCopy0 →
--   flatten_refactor_toCopy0_refactor_toCopy0`, etc.  The
--   structural reason this works is that
--   `refactor_nodeSplittingOn`'s J / V / E fields are unchanged
--   from `nodeSplittingOn`'s (the refactor changes only the L
--   side); every `change`-target, every `Finset.image_image`
--   fusion, every `Finset.image_congr` pointwise check has the
--   same shape after the rename.
--
-- * **L sub-goals (4 and 8) are structurally reworked for
--   `Sym2.map`.**  The original L-side threaded the lift through
--   `Prod.map flattenSplit flattenSplit` on ordered pairs; the
--   refactor threads it through `Sym2.map refactor_flattenSplit`
--   on the `Sym2`-quotient.  The double-image fuses via
--   `Finset.image_image` exactly as before, but the inner
--   map-composition `Sym2.map f ∘ Sym2.map g` fuses (now) to
--   `Sym2.map (f ∘ g)` via Mathlib's `Sym2.map_map`
--   (`Sym2.map g (Sym2.map f x) = Sym2.map (g ∘ f) x`).  The
--   pointwise close uses the inline helper
--   `flatten_refactor_toCopy0_refactor_toCopy0` (verbatim port of
--   `flatten_toCopy0_toCopy0`, all branches unchanged because the
--   tagged-sum carrier `refactor_SplitNode` is structurally the
--   same as the pre-refactor `SplitNode`).
--
-- * **Inline `have`-locals match the original's style.**  Per the
--   manager.md "Net-new helpers also need REPLACEMENT markers"
--   guidance: prefer inline `have`-locals over hoisted top-level
--   declarations.  The original `twoDisjointNodeSplittingsCommute`
--   keeps `flatten_toCopy0_toCopy0` / `flatten_toCopy1_toCopy1`
--   inline; we do the same with the `refactor_`-prefixed twins.
