# Topological order of a CDMG (`def_3_8`)

This file formalises the LN definition block `def_3_8`
(`\label{def-topological-order}` in `graphs.tex`):

> Let `G = (J, V, E, L)` be a CDMG.  A *topological order* of `G` is a
> total order `<` of `J ∪ V` such that for all `v, w ∈ G`:
> `v ∈ Pa^G(w) ⟹ v < w`.

The authoritative spec is the rewritten canonical tex statement at
`leanification/Chapter3_GraphTheory/Section3_1/tex/def_3_8_TopologicalOrder.tex`,
verified equivalent to the LN block.  No `addition_to_the_LN` clauses
were attached in `data.json`; the rewrite folded the two wording-check
subtleties `equivalent_indexing_assumes_finite_node_set` and
`quantifier_domain_v_w_in_G_is_tuple_not_set` directly into the
canonical tex as non-load-bearing clarifications.  Both
`verify_tex_statement_only` (structural) and
`verify_tex_statement_equivalence` (semantic) passed.

The rewrite's clarifications, for the record:

* `<` is read *strictly*: irreflexive (`¬ v < v`), transitive
  (`v < w` and `w < x` imply `v < x`), and trichotomous
  (`v < w`, `v = w`, or `w < v` for every `v, w ∈ J ∪ V`).
* The order's domain is `J ∪ V` (the LN's "for all `v, w ∈ G`"
  shorthand) — finite, by `def_3_1`'s `J, V : Finset Node`.
* The parent implication `v ∈ Pa^G(w) ⟹ v < w` is well-typed
  because `Pa^G(w) ⊆ J ∪ V` by `def_3_5` item~i (the parent-set
  body includes `w ∈ G`); see `Pa`'s design block in
  `FamilyRelationships.lean`.
* The "equivalent indexing form" `J ∪ V = {v_1, ..., v_K}` with
  `v_1 < ... < v_K` is *logically equivalent* to the primary
  (strict-total-order) form *because* `J ∪ V` is finite (any strict
  total order on a finite set has order type a finite ordinal and so
  can be presented as an enumeration).  We do NOT formalise the
  indexed form as a separate predicate — see the "Scope choice"
  bullet in the design block below.

The predicate `IsTopologicalOrder` below is a *property of an external
ordering*: it takes a strict relation `lt : Node → Node → Prop` as an
explicit argument and asserts that this particular `lt` is a topological
order of `G`.  The existence claim "a topological order of `G` exists"
is what `claim_3_2` ("acyclic iff a topological order exists") will
quantify over.

## Refactor `total_order_helper` (in progress)

The *original* `IsTopologicalOrder` — wrapped below in a
`-- REFACTOR-BLOCK-ORIGINAL-BEGIN: IsTopologicalOrder` /
`-- REFACTOR-BLOCK-ORIGINAL-END: IsTopologicalOrder` pair — was a flat
4-way `∧` that bundled three strict-total-order conjuncts (irreflexive,
transitive, trichotomous on `J ∪ V`) together with the topological
conjunct (`∀ v w, v ∈ G.Pa w → lt v w`).  The *replacement* — wrapped
below in matching `-- REFACTOR-BLOCK-REPLACEMENT-BEGIN: …` /
`-- REFACTOR-BLOCK-REPLACEMENT-END: …` pairs — introduces
`IsTotalOrder` as a named substantive sub-concept (mirroring the LN's
"*Let `<` be a total order of `J ∪ V`*" framing) and defines
`IsTopologicalOrder := IsTotalOrder ∧ parent_precedes` as a nested
2-conjunct.  The two shapes are logically equivalent — the conjuncts
unfold to exactly the same four propositions in the same order — but
the destructure pattern flips from
`⟨h_irrefl, h_trans, h_total, h_topo⟩` to
`⟨⟨h_irrefl, h_trans, h_total⟩, h_topo⟩` (and the constructor flips
symmetrically).  The refactor also exposes `IsTotalOrder` so that
`def_3_9`'s `Pred` / `PredLE` (the refactor's second root) can take
`(h : G.IsTotalOrder lt)` as an explicit type-level hypothesis,
closing the loosened-domain failure that `verify_equivalence` item~1a
and `verify_equivalence_strict`'s "loosening a quantifier's domain"
flag would otherwise propagate to every downstream consumer.

**Coexistence during the refactor.**  Both the original and the
replacement definitions live in this file as top-level declarations of
`Causality.CDMG` until Phase~7 cleanup of the refactor.  Consumers that
have not yet been re-validated (e.g.\ `claim_3_2`'s proof body) keep
calling the original `G.IsTopologicalOrder`, so the build stays green
throughout.  At cleanup, the original block is deleted and every
occurrence of `refactor_IsTotalOrder` / `refactor_IsTopologicalOrder`
across the chapter is renamed to the unprefixed form.

  for every `v, w ∈ J ∪ V`) — such that
    ∀ v, w ∈ J ∪ V :  v ∈ Pa^G(w)  ⟹  v < w.
-/
-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Predicate over an external ordering, not an existence claim.*
--   The LN reads "a topological order of `G` is a total order `<`
--   of `J ∪ V` such that …" — i.e. it characterises *which* orders
--   qualify, not whether one exists.  Mirroring this, the Lean
--   declaration is a `Prop`-valued predicate on `(G, lt)`:
--     `IsTopologicalOrder : CDMG Node → (Node → Node → Prop) → Prop`.
--   The downstream existence claim "an acyclic CDMG admits a
--   topological order" (`claim_3_2`) will be stated as
--   `G.IsAcyclic → ∃ lt, G.IsTopologicalOrder lt` — the existential is
--   *not* baked into this row's definition.  An alternative
--   "bundled" shape `structure TopologicalOrder (G) where lt + props`
--   was rejected on three grounds: (a) it would conflate the
--   *property* this row defines with the *witness data* that
--   `claim_3_2` will quantify over, breaking the LN's
--   property-vs-existence layering; (b) every consumer that just
--   wanted to *check* a candidate `lt` would have to package it into
--   a structure first, fighting the LN's reading; (c) a bundled
--   structure encourages downstream code to thread "the canonical
--   topological order" through a graph, but the LN never picks one —
--   multiple topological orders generally exist and the theory does
--   not privilege one.
--
-- *`lt : Node → Node → Prop` as an external argument, not a
--   typeclass `[LT Node]` or a structure field.*  Mathlib's
--   `[LT Node]` instance would force *exactly one* canonical `<` per
--   `Node` type — but a single `Node` type underlies *every* CDMG in
--   the codebase, and each CDMG may admit many different topological
--   orders; locking `<` to the type level would make the existence
--   claim of `claim_3_2` vacuous or false depending on the chosen
--   instance.  A typeclass `[CDMG.TopologicalOrder G]` would face the
--   same problem on the structure level (Lean's resolution forces
--   uniqueness).  An explicit `lt : Node → Node → Prop` argument
--   exposes the choice and lets `claim_3_2` quantify over it
--   existentially.
--
-- *Strict-total-order conjuncts unfolded inline, not Mathlib's
--   `IsStrictTotalOrder lt`.*  Mathlib's `IsStrictTotalOrder` class
--   asserts irreflexivity / transitivity / trichotomy *on the entire
--   ambient type `Node`*; ours must be restricted to `J ∪ V`.  Using
--   the typeclass would either (a) force `lt` to behave as a strict
--   total order on the *full* `Node` type — a stronger requirement
--   than the LN, ruling out perfectly valid orders that happen to
--   leave nodes outside `J ∪ V` unrelated — or (b) require a
--   restriction wrapper (a fresh subtype `↥(G.J ∪ G.V)` and a derived
--   relation), which would force every downstream use to coerce nodes
--   and relations across the subtype boundary.  Unfolding the three
--   conjuncts inline with `∀ v ∈ G, …` is the cleanest LN-faithful
--   form: the LN literally writes "for every `v, w ∈ J ∪ V`", and
--   `∀ v ∈ G, …` is the standard Lean rendering (via the
--   `Membership Node (CDMG Node)` instance from `def_3_2`).  A custom
--   helper `IsStrictTotalOrderOn (S : Finset Node) (lt) : Prop` was
--   considered and rejected as scope creep — no other row in the
--   chapter currently needs it, and bundling the three conjuncts
--   under a fresh name would obscure the LN's plain reading "strict
--   total order on `J ∪ V`".
--
-- *Three properties of `<` *plus* the parent-precedes conjunct —
--   four conjuncts in LN order.*  The LN's prose enumerates: (1)
--   irreflexive, (2) transitive, (3) trichotomous, (4) parents
--   precede.  We encode it as a four-fold `∧` in the same order.
--   Mirroring LN order keeps `obtain ⟨hi, htr, htri, hp⟩ := h`
--   downstream destructuring syntactically aligned with the LN
--   reading.  Lean's `∧` is right-associative, so this parses as
--   `h_irrefl ∧ (h_trans ∧ (h_tri ∧ h_parent))`; the
--   anonymous-constructor pattern `⟨_, _, _, _⟩` unpacks all four
--   on one line.
--
-- *Trichotomy disjunct order: `lt v w ∨ v = w ∨ lt w v` (Mathlib's
--   `Trichotomous` convention).*  Mathlib defines
--   `Trichotomous (r : α → α → Prop)` as `∀ a b, r a b ∨ a = b ∨ r b a`
--   — the equality case sits in the *middle* slot.  Adopting the
--   alternative order `lt v w ∨ lt w v ∨ v = w` would (i) force every
--   downstream destructure that mirrors Mathlib's
--   `rcases h with hlt | heq | hlt'` shape to flip alternatives, and
--   (ii) if a later proof ever lifts this predicate to a Mathlib
--   `Trichotomous` instance on a subtype `↥(G.J ∪ G.V)` (to reuse
--   strict-total-order lemmas), the disjunct shape would need
--   translating.  The LN's "`v < w`, `v = w`, or `w < v`" is
--   symmetric in disjunct order, so this is a free choice we spend
--   on Mathlib alignment.
--
-- *Parent implication: no explicit `v ∈ G`/`w ∈ G` guard.*  The
--   universal `∀ v w, v ∈ G.Pa w → lt v w` is well-typed without
--   guards because `def_3_5`'s `Pa G w := {u | u ∈ G ∧ (u, w) ∈ G.E}`
--   *already* forces (i) `v ∈ G` (= `v ∈ J ∪ V`) directly from the
--   `u ∈ G` conjunct of the set-builder body, and (ii) `w ∈ G` from
--   `def_3_1`'s `hE_subset : (u, w) ∈ G.E → u ∈ J ∪ V ∧ w ∈ V` (so
--   `w ∈ V ⊆ J ∪ V`).  Adding `v ∈ G → w ∈ G →` guards would be
--   redundant.  The LN's "for all `v, w ∈ J ∪ V`" prefix is what the
--   `Pa`-body already encodes, so the universal `∀ v w` form is both
--   LN-faithful in conclusion and stronger-looking in quantifier
--   scope; logically the two are equivalent.  Wording-check subtlety
--   `quantifier_domain_v_w_in_G_is_tuple_not_set` (the LN's literal
--   "for all `v, w ∈ G`" with `G` a 4-tuple) is resolved by reading
--   `v ∈ G` via `def_3_2` item~1 as `v ∈ J ∪ V`; the redundancy
--   above means the Lean encoding can drop the prefix without
--   semantic loss.
--
-- *No `v ≠ w` precondition on the parent implication, even though
--   `lt v v` is forbidden by irreflexivity.*  The LN's implication
--   reads `v ∈ Pa^G(w) ⟹ v < w` without case-splitting on `v = w`.
--   When `v = w` and `(v, v) ∈ G.E` (i.e.\ a directed self-loop is
--   present), the implication would force `lt v v` — which
--   contradicts irreflexivity.  So the existence of *any*
--   topological order entails the absence of directed self-loops on
--   nodes of `J ∪ V`, which is exactly the consequence
--   `def_3_6`'s `IsAcyclic` encodes (see `Acyclicity.lean`'s
--   "Consequence: no directed self-loops" paragraph).  This
--   matching constraint is *load-bearing* for `claim_3_2`'s "acyclic
--   iff topological order exists" direction: a topological order
--   exists ⟹ the graph is acyclic (via, among other things, no
--   self-loops).  Inserting a `v ≠ w` guard here would silently
--   weaken the predicate and break that direction of `claim_3_2`.
--
-- *`Pa G w` (`Set Node`), not `Finset Node` or a `(w, v) ∈ G.E`
--   spelling.*  Reuse of `def_3_5`'s `G.Pa w` keeps the chapter's
--   parent vocabulary uniform; downstream proofs of `claim_3_2` can
--   unfold `Pa` (one `unfold CDMG.Pa` step lands on
--   `{u | u ∈ G ∧ (u, w) ∈ G.E}`) when they need the literal edge
--   form, but the named `Pa` form keeps the LN-grep correspondence
--   intact.  Spelling the implication as `(v, w) ∈ G.E → lt v w`
--   would lose the `v ∈ G` witness baked into `Pa`'s body and would
--   require either re-deriving `v ∈ J ∪ V` from `hE_subset` at every
--   use site or weakening the LN-faithful parent reading.
--
-- *Scope choice: only the primary (strict-total-order) form is
--   formalised; the "Equivalent indexing form"
--   `J ∪ V = {v_1, …, v_K}` with `v_1 < … < v_K` is NOT a separate
--   declaration.*  The rewritten canonical tex spells out *both*
--   forms and proves them equivalent under finiteness; per the
--   manager-brief's "Design considerations" §4, we encode the primary
--   form only and leave the indexed form to a *separate downstream
--   theorem* (roughly `∃ K : ℕ, ∃ idx : Fin K → Node, …` shape) any
--   consumer can derive on demand — a finite strict total order is
--   `Equiv`-able to `Fin K` ordered by `<`, and `J ∪ V` is finite by
--   `def_3_1`'s `Finset`-valued `J, V`.  A future reader hunting for
--   the indexing form should look for that derived theorem, not for
--   a parallel predicate here.  Two
--   reasons: (a) introducing an `IsTopologicalOrderIndexed` parallel
--   predicate would invite spurious case-splits at every downstream
--   site over which form is in scope, while the LN treats the two as
--   logically identical "presentations" of one notion; (b) the
--   indexed form is essentially a `(Fin K → Node)` bijection plus an
--   order-respecting condition, and constructing the bijection
--   requires picking a specific enumeration — but the LN never picks
--   one, so any choice we make in Lean would be arbitrary and
--   inherited by every downstream consumer of the indexed form.
--   Sticking to the primary predicate keeps the API minimal.
--
-- *Mathlib re-use.*  `Membership Node (CDMG Node)` instance from
--   `def_3_2` (used by `∀ v ∈ G, …`).  `Set` and `∈` on `G.Pa w` come
--   from `def_3_5`.  No mathlib `IsStrictTotalOrder` / `LinearOrder`
--   / `Preorder` machinery: those are type-level, not
--   domain-restricted, and would over-commit `lt` on nodes outside
--   `J ∪ V` (see the typeclass discussion above).
--
-- *Downstream consumers.*  `claim_3_2` (the very next row in the LN)
--   states `G.IsAcyclic ↔ ∃ lt, G.IsTopologicalOrder lt`; its proof
--   destructures this four-conjunct shape both ways
--   (`obtain ⟨hi, htr, htri, hp⟩` for the ⟸ direction, anonymous
--   constructor for the ⟹ direction's witness construction).
--   Chapter 4 onwards (CBN factorisation, do-calculus, iSCMs) will
--   index over a topological order chosen from `claim_3_2`'s
--   existential, taking a single `(h : G.IsTopologicalOrder lt)`
--   hypothesis and destructuring the parent conjunct `hp` at the
--   point where the factorisation needs "every parent comes earlier
--   in the order".

-/
-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Why a named helper predicate, separate from
--   `IsTopologicalOrder`.*  The LN reads "Let `<` be a *total order*
--   of `J ∪ V` such that ..." -- it treats "total order on `J ∪ V`"
--   as a named substantive sub-concept, mentioned in prose rather
--   than defined in its own `defmark` block.  The original flat
--   4-way `∧` encoding (see the `REFACTOR-BLOCK-ORIGINAL` block
--   above) silently merged the total-order conjuncts into
--   `IsTopologicalOrder`, leaving downstream rows no handle to refer
--   to "just the total-order premise".  Pulling the predicate out
--   exposes the LN's two-tier reading at the type level.  All three
--   signals from `formalize_definition_in_lean.md` §"Helper
--   predicates for substantive sub-concepts" are met:
--   (a) **referenced by spec** -- the rewritten canonical tex literally
--   writes "a *strict* total order `<` on `J ∪ V`" (see the LN tex
--   fragment above);
--   (b) **substantive content** -- three atomic conditions
--   (irreflexive, transitive, trichotomous), not a single one-liner;
--   (c) **reused by a downstream row** -- `def_3_9`'s `Pred` and
--   `PredLE` (`Predecessors.lean`) consume
--   `Pred^G_<(v) = {w ∈ J ∪ V ∣ w < v}`, which is meaningful for
--   *any* total order on `J ∪ V` (no parent-precedence required); ch.\
--   5's ID-algorithm chapter (id-algorithm.tex §"preceding Markov
--   blanket", lines 227-240) likewise slices `J ∪ V` into
--   `{w | w < v}`, `{v}`, `{w | v < w}` purely via the total-order
--   content, and ch.\ 5's factorisation step (id-algorithm.tex line
--   466) takes "the reverse topological order" -- an order-reversal
--   operation on the total-order content alone.  Without the helper,
--   every such consumer would either re-spell the three atomic
--   conditions or import the whole `IsTopologicalOrder` (silently
--   over-committing on the parent-precedence clause).
--
-- *Closes the loosened-domain failure in `def_3_9` (the refactor's
--   second root).*  Pre-refactor, `Pred (G) (lt : Node → Node → Prop)
--   (v : Node)` was well-typed for *any* binary relation `lt`, but
--   the LN's `Pred^G_<(v)` is only well-defined when `<` is a total
--   order on `J ∪ V`.  This is the failure pattern
--   `verify_equivalence` item~1a flags ("hypothesis dropped from
--   Lean's type contract; only documented in design comments") and
--   `verify_equivalence_strict` calls "loosening a quantifier's
--   domain".  By exposing `IsTotalOrder` here, `def_3_9` can now take
--   `(h : G.IsTotalOrder lt)` as an explicit hypothesis on
--   `Pred` / `PredLE`, closing the leak at the source.
--
-- *Strict reading of `<`: irreflexive, transitive, trichotomous.*
--   Carried over verbatim from the original `IsTopologicalOrder`
--   design block: the LN's order symbol `<` is read strictly
--   throughout, so the three properties pin down a strict total
--   order rather than a `≤`-style order.  The rewritten canonical
--   tex makes this explicit by writing "*strict* total order" and
--   spelling out the trichotomy disjunct.  Wording-check subtlety
--   `equivalent_indexing_assumes_finite_node_set` is unaffected
--   (finiteness still holds via `def_3_1`'s `Finset`-valued
--   `J, V`); `quantifier_domain_v_w_in_G_is_tuple_not_set` is
--   resolved exactly as before via the `Membership Node (CDMG Node)`
--   instance from `def_3_2`.
--
-- *Domain `J ∪ V`, encoded via `∀ v ∈ G, …`.*  The
--   `Membership Node (CDMG Node)` instance from `def_3_2`
--   (`CDMGNotation.lean`) makes `v ∈ G` reduce to
--   `v ∈ G.J ∪ G.V`, so the three conjuncts quantify over the LN's
--   node set on the nose.  Restricting to `J ∪ V` (rather than the
--   ambient `Node` type) is load-bearing: the LN never asks `<` to
--   relate nodes outside `J ∪ V`, and Mathlib's
--   `IsStrictTotalOrder` typeclass would over-commit `lt` on the
--   whole `Node` type -- ruling out perfectly valid orders that
--   happen to leave non-`G` nodes unrelated, and tying the canonical
--   `<` to the type-level (the same uniqueness problem rejected in
--   the original block's typeclass discussion).  A custom
--   `IsStrictTotalOrderOn (S : Finset Node) (lt) : Prop` was
--   considered and rejected for the same reasons as the original
--   block: bundling the three conjuncts under a fresh name would
--   obscure the LN's plain "strict total order on `J ∪ V`" reading
--   without offering anything `∀ v ∈ G, …` does not already.
--
-- *Trichotomy disjunct order: `lt v w ∨ v = w ∨ lt w v` (Mathlib's
--   `Trichotomous` convention).*  Mathlib's
--   `Trichotomous (r : α → α → Prop)` places the equality case in
--   the middle slot; we adopt that order so any future lift to a
--   `Trichotomous` instance on the subtype `↥(G.J ∪ G.V)` (or any
--   `rcases h with hlt | heq | hlt'` destructure mirroring Mathlib
--   convention) lines up without alternative-flipping.  The LN's
--   "`v < w`, `v = w`, or `w < v`" is symmetric in disjunct order,
--   so this is a free choice we spend on Mathlib alignment.  Same
--   rationale and conclusion as the original block.
--
-- *Three-dash `--- start helper` markers, not the two-dash
--   `-- start statement`.*  `IsTotalOrder` is a *helper-for-statement*
--   in the row-worker sense: the row's primary LN content is
--   `IsTopologicalOrder` (which gets the two-dash statement markers
--   below); `IsTotalOrder` exists to support its definition and to
--   carry the LN's "let `<` be a total order" hypothesis through
--   downstream consumers.  The website builder pulls helper-marked
--   declarations alongside the main statement so the rendered
--   statement is self-contained.  Matches the helper-vs-statement
--   convention used throughout the chapter.
--
-- *`Prop`-valued predicate, not a `structure` / `class`.*  Mirrors
--   the original `IsTopologicalOrder` block's "no bundled-structure
--   shape" rationale: multiple total orders may coexist on a fixed
--   `G`, and an `lt : Node → Node → Prop` plus
--   `(h : G.IsTotalOrder lt)` hypothesis lets the existence
--   quantifier of `claim_3_2` (and the chosen-order parameter of
--   ch.\ 4 CBN factorisation, ch.\ 5 ID-algorithm) range over
--   relations freely.  A bundled
--   `structure TotalOrder G where lt + h_irrefl + h_trans + h_total`
--   was rejected on the same three grounds the original
--   `IsTopologicalOrder` block uses: (a) it conflates the
--   *property* (`G.IsTotalOrder lt`) with *witness data* (`lt`
--   itself), (b) consumers wanting to *check* a candidate `lt`
--   would have to package it into a structure first, (c) it tempts
--   downstream code to single out "the canonical total order" the
--   LN never picks.
--
-- *`def : Prop`, not a typeclass or structure.*  Beyond the
--   domain-restriction argument above, three further reasons rule
--   out a `class IsTotalOrderOn ...` or `instance : IsTotalOrder
--   ...` shape.  (a) **LN-faithfulness**: the LN's "total order of
--   `J ∪ V`" is a *property of a chosen relation*, not a typeclass
--   instance the type system resolves silently; a `def` returning
--   `Prop` is the closest Lean rendering of that prose reading.
--   (b) **No instance plumbing at every use site**: a class would
--   force every consumer (`def_3_9`'s `Pred`, ch.\ 4's CBN
--   factorisation, ch.\ 5's ID-algorithm, ch.\ 7's acyclification)
--   to either thread `[G.IsTotalOrder lt]` brackets through every
--   signature or rely on Lean's resolver to surface the witness --
--   neither matches the LN's pattern of *naming* the order
--   explicitly and quantifying over it.  (c) **No need to invent a
--   wrapper relation**: `lt` is already the bare `Node → Node →
--   Prop` the LN writes -- there is no subtype `↥(G.J ∪ G.V)` or
--   `Restricted lt` to define and pass around.  Reusing a Mathlib
--   typeclass would have required first manufacturing such a
--   wrapper, then proving an instance for it, then peeling the
--   wrapper back off at every use site that wants the raw `lt v w`
--   form the LN uses.  A `def : Prop` skips that round-trip.
--
-- *Mathlib re-use.*  Same surface area as the original block:
--   `Membership Node (CDMG Node)` instance from `def_3_2`.  No
--   mathlib `IsStrictTotalOrder` / `LinearOrder` / `Preorder` --
--   those are type-level, not domain-restricted, and would
--   over-commit `lt` on the whole `Node` type (see the domain
--   and typeclass-rejection discussions above).
--
-- *Downstream consumers.*  `def_3_9` (`Predecessors.lean`) takes
--   `(h : G.IsTotalOrder lt)` as an explicit hypothesis on
--   `Pred` / `PredLE` (the refactor's second root).  `claim_3_2`
--   (`AcyclicIffTopologicalOrder.lean`) accesses the total-order
--   content via the first projection of the nested
--   `IsTopologicalOrder` shape (`(h_topo : G.IsTopologicalOrder
--   lt).1 : G.IsTotalOrder lt`); its proof body destructures
--   further as `⟨h_irrefl, h_trans, h_total⟩`.  Ch.\ 4-10 consumers
--   that take a topological-order hypothesis and reach into the
--   total-order content (e.g.\ ch.\ 5's `Pred^G_<(v)` slicing,
--   ch.\ 5's factorisation reverse-ordering, ch.\ 7's
--   acyclification ordering on SCCs) all reuse this projection
--   pattern.

-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Structural change from flat 4-conjunct to nested 2-conjunct.*
--   The original (`REFACTOR-BLOCK-ORIGINAL` above) was
--     `(∀ v ∈ G, ¬ lt v v) ∧
--      (∀ u v w ∈ G, lt u v → lt v w → lt u w) ∧
--      (∀ v w ∈ G, lt v w ∨ v = w ∨ lt w v) ∧
--      (∀ v w, v ∈ G.Pa w → lt v w)`
--   -- four conjuncts in a flat right-associative `∧`.  The new
--   encoding is
--     `G.IsTotalOrder lt ∧ (∀ v w, v ∈ G.Pa w → lt v w)`
--   -- two conjuncts, with the first three (irreflexive, transitive,
--   trichotomous on `J ∪ V`) packaged into the helper predicate
--   `IsTotalOrder` introduced above.  The two shapes are logically
--   equivalent (`G.IsTotalOrder lt` unfolds *definitionally* to the
--   conjunction of exactly the same three atomic propositions in the
--   same order), but the *destructure pattern* changes:
--     - **Old:** `obtain ⟨h_irrefl, h_trans, h_total, h_topo⟩ := h`
--     - **New (one step):**
--         `obtain ⟨⟨h_irrefl, h_trans, h_total⟩, h_topo⟩ := h`
--     - **New (two steps):**
--         `obtain ⟨h_to, h_topo⟩ := h`
--         `obtain ⟨h_irrefl, h_trans, h_total⟩ := h_to`
--   The constructor pattern flips symmetrically:
--     - **Old:** `refine ⟨irrefl_pf, trans_pf, total_pf, topo_pf⟩`
--     - **New:** `refine ⟨⟨irrefl_pf, trans_pf, total_pf⟩, topo_pf⟩`
--   The change mirrors the LN's two-tier reading "Let `<` be a
--   *total order* of `J ∪ V` *such that* ... whenever
--   `v ∈ Pa^G(w)` we have `v < w`" (graphs.tex around the
--   topological-order `defmark` block): the LN names the
--   total-order premise as a substantive sub-concept and only then
--   layers the parent-precedence clause on top.  See the
--   `IsTotalOrder` REPLACEMENT block above for why the helper earns
--   its own name.  `claim_3_2`'s proof body (refactor-row of its
--   own) will update both destructure / construct sites to the
--   nested shape; the theorem statement is unchanged.
--
-- *Predicate over an external ordering, not an existence claim.*
--   Carried over from the original block: the LN reads "a
--   topological order of `G` is a total order `<` of `J ∪ V` such
--   that ...", i.e.\ it characterises *which* orders qualify, not
--   whether one exists.  The Lean is a `Prop`-valued predicate on
--   `(G, lt)`, and `claim_3_2` (the very next row) states
--   `G.IsAcyclic ↔ ∃ lt, G.IsTopologicalOrder lt` -- existence is at
--   the use site, not baked into this definition.
--   Bundled-structure alternatives (`structure TopologicalOrder (G)
--   where lt + props`) were rejected for the three reasons spelled
--   out in the original block: (a) conflates property with witness
--   data; (b) forces consumers to package a candidate `lt` into a
--   structure just to *check* it (fighting the LN's reading);
--   (c) tempts downstream code to single out "the canonical
--   topological order" the LN never picks (multiple typically
--   coexist).
--
-- *`lt : Node → Node → Prop` as an explicit external argument, not
--   a typeclass `[LT Node]` or a structure field.*  Carried over
--   from the original block.  Mathlib's `[LT Node]` would force
--   exactly one canonical `<` per `Node` type -- but a single `Node`
--   underlies every CDMG in the codebase and each CDMG may admit
--   many topological orders; locking `<` to the type level would
--   make `claim_3_2`'s existential vacuous or false depending on
--   the chosen instance.  A typeclass
--   `[CDMG.TopologicalOrder G]` would face the same
--   Lean-resolution-forces-uniqueness problem on the structure
--   level.  An explicit relation argument exposes the choice and
--   lets `claim_3_2` quantify over it.
--
-- *Parent implication: no `v ≠ w` guard, no `v ∈ G` / `w ∈ G`
--   guard.*  Carried over from the original block -- the rationale
--   is unchanged by the refactor.  (i) `def_3_5`'s
--   `Pa G w := {u | u ∈ G ∧ (u, w) ∈ G.E}` already forces
--   `v ∈ G` from the set-builder body and `w ∈ G` from `def_3_1`'s
--   `hE_subset`, so `v ∈ G → w ∈ G →` guards would be redundant.
--   This is the working-phase wording-check subtlety
--   `quantifier_domain_v_w_in_G_is_tuple_not_set`: the LN's literal
--   "for all `v, w ∈ G`" with `G` a 4-tuple is shorthand for
--   `v, w ∈ J ∪ V`, and parenthood already entails that membership
--   for both endpoints -- so the unrestricted `∀ v w, v ∈ G.Pa w
--   → lt v w` is both LN-faithful in conclusion and *stronger-looking*
--   only in quantifier scope (logically the two forms agree).
--   (ii) Omitting the `v ≠ w` guard is *load-bearing* for
--   `claim_3_2`: when `v = w` and a directed self-loop
--   `(v, v) ∈ G.E` is present, the parent implication forces
--   `lt v v`, contradicting irreflexivity (the first conjunct of
--   `IsTotalOrder`).  So the existence of any topological order
--   entails the absence of directed self-loops on `J ∪ V`, which
--   is exactly what `def_3_6`'s `IsAcyclic` encodes; this matching
--   constraint drives the `⇐` direction of `claim_3_2`.  Inserting
--   a `v ≠ w` guard here would silently weaken the predicate and
--   break that direction.
--
-- *`Pa G w` (`Set Node`), not `Finset Node` or `(w, v) ∈ G.E`.*
--   Carried over from the original block.  Reuse of `def_3_5`'s
--   parent vocabulary keeps the chapter uniform; downstream proofs
--   can `unfold CDMG.Pa` when they need the literal edge form.
--   Spelling the implication as `(v, w) ∈ G.E → lt v w` would lose
--   the `v ∈ G` witness baked into `Pa`'s body and would require
--   re-deriving `v ∈ J ∪ V` from `hE_subset` at every use site, or
--   weaken the LN-faithful parent reading.
--
-- *Scope choice: primary form only; indexed form is a downstream
--   theorem.*  Carried over from the original block.  The rewritten
--   canonical tex spells out both the strict-total-order form and
--   the "`J ∪ V = {v_1, …, v_K}` with `v_1 < … < v_K`" indexed
--   form, and proves them equivalent under finiteness.  We encode
--   the primary form only; any consumer that needs the indexed
--   form derives it on demand (a finite strict total order is
--   `Equiv`-able to `Fin K` ordered by `<`, and `J ∪ V` is finite
--   by `def_3_1`'s `Finset`-valued `J, V`).  This is exactly the
--   working-phase wording-check subtlety
--   `equivalent_indexing_assumes_finite_node_set`: the LN's
--   "Equivalently ..." clause is *only* an equivalence under
--   finiteness (any strict total order on a finite set has order
--   type a finite ordinal and so can be presented as
--   `v_1 < ... < v_K`); on an infinite node set the primary form
--   is still meaningful but the indexing form would either fail or
--   need extra conditions.  Formalising the primary form keeps
--   `IsTopologicalOrder` general (no implicit finiteness baked
--   into its type contract); finiteness for the indexed
--   reformulation is available *when needed* via `def_3_1`'s
--   `Finset`-valued `J, V`, so no consumer is shut out.  A parallel
--   `IsTopologicalOrderIndexed` predicate would invite spurious
--   case-splits at every downstream site over which form is in
--   scope, while the LN treats the two as logically identical
--   "presentations" of one notion (under finiteness).
--
-- *Mathlib re-use.*  Same surface area as the original block:
--   `Membership Node (CDMG Node)` instance from `def_3_2` (used
--   inside `G.IsTotalOrder lt`'s conjuncts), `Set` and `∈` on
--   `G.Pa w` from `def_3_5`.  No mathlib `IsStrictTotalOrder` /
--   `LinearOrder` / `Preorder` for the reasons spelled out in the
--   `IsTotalOrder` REPLACEMENT block above.
--
-- *Refactor coexistence note.*  Until Phase~7 cleanup, the original
--   flat-4-conjunct `IsTopologicalOrder` (in the
--   `REFACTOR-BLOCK-ORIGINAL` block above) and this nested
--   `refactor_IsTopologicalOrder` both exist as top-level
--   declarations of `Causality.CDMG`.  The body below uses
--   `G.refactor_IsTotalOrder lt` (not `G.IsTotalOrder lt`) so that
--   the file type-checks before cleanup -- the cleanup script will
--   flip every `refactor_IsTotalOrder` / `refactor_IsTopologicalOrder`
--   occurrence to the unprefixed form across all touched files.
--   Consumers that have not yet been re-validated (e.g.\ `claim_3_2`'s
--   proof body) keep calling the original `G.IsTopologicalOrder`,
--   so the build stays green throughout the refactor.
--
-- *Downstream consumers (post-refactor).*  `def_3_9`
--   (`Predecessors.lean`) takes `(h : G.IsTotalOrder lt)` as an
--   explicit type-level hypothesis on `Pred` / `PredLE`; from a
--   topological-order witness this is reached via the first
--   projection `(h_topo : G.IsTopologicalOrder lt).1`.  `claim_3_2`
--   (`AcyclicIffTopologicalOrder.lean`) destructures the nested
--   2-conjunct shape both ways (`⟨⟨h_irrefl, h_trans, h_total⟩,
--   h_topo⟩` on inputs; the symmetric nested anonymous constructor
--   on outputs) -- its proof body, refactored in a separate row of
--   this refactor table, is the test case for the new shape.
--   Ch.\ 4 onwards (CBN factorisation, ID-algorithm, σ /
--   d-separation, iSCMs) typically takes
--   `(h : G.IsTopologicalOrder lt)` and projects either via `.1`
--   for the total-order content (e.g.\ to feed
--   `Pred^G_<(v) := {w ∈ G | lt w v}` to `def_3_9` or to slice
--   `J ∪ V` into `{w | w < v}`, `{v}`, `{w | v < w}` for an
--   id-separation argument) or via `.2` for the parent-precedence
--   clause (e.g.\ when factorising a joint kernel into mechanism
--   conditionals).
