# Acyclicity is equivalent to existence of a topological order (`claim_3_2`)

This file formalises the LN lemma block `claim_3_2` from `graphs.tex`,
immediately following `def-topological-order`:

> A CDMG `G = (J, V, E, L)` is acyclic if and only if it has a
> topological order.

The authoritative spec is the rewritten canonical tex statement at
`leanification/Chapter3_GraphTheory/Section3_1/tex/`
`claim_3_2_statement_AcyclicIffTopologicalOrder.tex`, verified
equivalent to the LN block.  The row carries an empty
`addition_to_the_LN`; the LN-critic wording-check returned
`NO_SUBTLETIES`.  The literal LN sentence is authoritative.

Both sides of the biconditional refer to upstream chapter-3 predicates
already in this folder:

* `G.IsAcyclic` from `def_3_6` (`Acyclicity.lean`) — there does not
  exist a non-trivial directed walk from any node `v ∈ J ∪ V` back to
  itself.
* `G.IsTopologicalOrder lt` from `def_3_8` (`TopologicalOrder.lean`) —
  the four-conjunct `Prop` predicate on an external relation
  `lt : Node → Node → Prop` asserting (i) irreflexivity on `J ∪ V`,
  (ii) transitivity on `J ∪ V`, (iii) trichotomy on `J ∪ V`, and (iv)
  `v ∈ Pa^G(w) → lt v w` (parents precede their children).

Because `def_3_8` characterises *which* relations qualify as a
topological order (rather than asserting one exists), "G has a
topological order" reads in Lean as the existential
`∃ lt : Node → Node → Prop, G.IsTopologicalOrder lt` — exactly the
shape that `def_3_8`'s "Downstream consumers" design block
anticipates.  The label set `L` of `def_3_1` plays no role on either
side of the biconditional; the result is a property of the
`(J, V, E)`-skeleton of `G` only.

The theorem body is filled in by `prove_claim_in_lean` (Manager B),
following the verified TeX proof at
`tex/claim_3_2_proof_AcyclicIffTopologicalOrder.tex`.  Proof-only
helpers (walk concatenation, source/target-in-`G` for non-trivial
directed walks, single-edge directed walk, walk-induction on `lt`)
live just below the `variable` block, outside the marker zones
because they are not statement content.

-- ## Design choice — statement context
--
-- *`Node : Type*` with `[DecidableEq Node]`.*  Inherited verbatim from
--   `def_3_1` (`CDMG.lean`).  Both fixtures are load-bearing here
--   because the theorem signature references `CDMG Node`, `G.IsAcyclic`
--   and `G.IsTopologicalOrder`, each of which depends on
--   `[DecidableEq Node]` (the `Finset`-backed membership tests in
--   `G.J ∪ G.V`, the `v ∈ G` quantifier scope via the `Membership`
--   instance from `def_3_2`, and the `Walk.IsDirectedWalk` recursive
--   check in `def_3_6` all require it).  Stronger instances
--   (`Fintype`, `LinearOrder`) are not needed at the statement level
--   and would over-commit — the proof body (handled separately) may

LN tex (rewritten canonical statement for `claim_3_2`):

  Let `G = (J, V, E, L)` be a CDMG.  Then `G` is acyclic (in the sense
  of def_3_6) iff there exists a topological order of `G` (in the
  sense of def_3_8); equivalently, `G` is acyclic iff there exists a
  strict total order `<` on `J ∪ V` — i.e.\ a binary relation `<` on
  `J ∪ V` that is irreflexive, transitive, and trichotomous — such
  that, for every `v, w ∈ J ∪ V`, `v ∈ Pa^G(w) ⟹ v < w`.  The label
  set `L` plays no role on either side of the biconditional.
-/
-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Shape of the biconditional.*  The signature
--     `G.IsAcyclic ↔ ∃ lt : Node → Node → Prop, G.IsTopologicalOrder lt`
--   is the literal rendering of the LN's "is acyclic iff has a
--   topological order": `↔` for "iff", `∃ lt : Node → Node → Prop` for
--   "has a", and `IsTopologicalOrder` for "topological order"
--   -- the predicate from `def_3_8` (`TopologicalOrder.lean`)
--   characterising which `lt` qualify, with content
--     `G.IsTotalOrder lt ∧ (∀ v w, v ∈ G.Pa w → lt v w)`
--   (the strict-total-order helper `IsTotalOrder` plus parent
--   precedence).  The biconditional is bundled in a single `Iff`:
--   consumers reach `.mp` (acyclic ⟹ a topological order exists -- the
--   workhorse projection for chapter 4+ CBN factorisation / do-calculus
--   that index parent-first traversals over an ADMG, since `IsADMG`
--   carries `IsAcyclic` as its first conjunct per `CDMGTypes.lean`) or
--   `.mpr` (topological order ⟹ acyclic -- the certificate route used
--   by causal-discovery algorithms in chapter 11+ that construct an
--   ordering and need to conclude acyclicity) without a per-direction
--   lemma split.  Splitting into two named theorems was considered and
--   rejected: the LN treats this as one claim, every downstream site
--   needs only one direction at a time (reached via `.mp` / `.mpr` at
--   zero cost), and the bundled `↔` keeps the LN ↔ Lean cross-reference
--   grep-able under a single name.
--
-- *Why the nested 2-conjunct shape for "topological order".*  Inherited
--   from `def_3_8` (`TopologicalOrder.lean`): the four atomic axioms
--   (irreflexivity, transitivity, trichotomy, parent-precedes) are
--   packaged so that the first three -- a strict total order on
--   `J ∪ V` -- live in a separately-named predicate
--   `IsTotalOrder G lt` that downstream rows (e.g. `def_3_9`'s
--   `Pred` / `PredLE`) can carry as an explicit hypothesis without
--   dragging the parent-precedence requirement along.  The LN-level
--   mathematical content of `claim_3_2` is *unchanged* by this
--   packaging -- the predicate unfolds to the same four atomic
--   propositions in the same order -- only how "is a topological order"
--   is *expressed* in Lean.  Naming the strict-total-order sub-concept
--   is what makes the rest of the chapter able to refer to it directly;
--   see `TopologicalOrder.lean` for the predicate definitions and the
--   sub-concept's motivation.
--
-- *Why `∃ lt : Node → Node → Prop` over a bundled order.*  Bare
--   `Node → Node → Prop` matches the LN's phrasing "has a topological
--   order" most directly: a topological order is *data* (a relation
--   between specific nodes), not a typeclass, and `∃` is the most
--   direct rendering of "has".  Bundled alternatives considered and
--   rejected:
--   * `[LinearOrder Node]` typeclass forces totality / transitivity /
--     antisymmetry on the *full* `Node` type, excluding perfectly
--     valid orders that leave nodes outside `J ∪ V` unrelated -- the
--     LN only requires totality on `J ∪ V`.
--   * Subtype-restricted `LinearOrder ↥(G.J ∪ G.V)` avoids the
--     over-commitment but forces every consumer to coerce nodes across
--     the `↥`-boundary at every use site.  `def_3_8`'s predicate
--     rejected this on the same grounds; we inherit the choice.
--   * `List Node` ordered by index would bake in a specific enumeration
--     -- the LN reasons about topological order as a property of a
--     relation, not as a list, and the proof's parent-less-pick
--     construction can produce many distinct lists from the same
--     partial order.
--   * `∃!`-strengthened or `Classical.choice`-extracted canonical order
--     would inject uniqueness the LN never claims; many linear
--     refinements of the parent-precedence partial order qualify.
--   The chosen shape preserves the LN's reasoning about *which* order
--   to pick (the proof constructs one by walk-reachability + Szpilrajn
--   extension) without committing the type to any global order
--   structure.
--
-- *Proof body: same mathematics, witness-assembly tracks the nested
--   shape.*  The proof's *mathematical* structure follows the LN
--   verbatim:
--   * (⇒) walk-reachability `le₀ u v := u = v ∨ ∃ directed walk
--     u → v of length ≥ 1` is shown to be a partial order (refl / trans
--     via `Walk.comp`, antisymm via acyclicity ruling out the cycle
--     formed by concatenating opposing non-trivial walks), Mathlib's
--     Szpilrajn `extend_partialOrder` yields a linear refinement `s`,
--     and `lt u v := s u v ∧ u ≠ v` reads off the strict order
--     witnessing `IsTopologicalOrder` -- a "semantic"
--     Leanification of the LN's inductive parent-less-pick
--     construction.
--   * (⇐) a hypothetical non-trivial directed cycle `v → ⋯ → v` would
--     force `lt v v` via `Walk.lt_of_directedWalk_pos` (which walks
--     along edges using transitivity + parent-precedes), contradicting
--     irreflexivity.
--   The *witness assembly* tracks the nested encoding via
--   `IsTotalOrder`'s natural smart constructor: in (⇒) the
--   final `refine ⟨fun u v => s u v ∧ u ≠ v, ⟨?_, ?_, ?_⟩, ?_⟩` is the
--   anonymous-constructor analogue of `IsTotalOrder.intro`
--   for the three total-order axioms (irreflexivity / transitivity /
--   trichotomy), followed by the parent-precedes conjunct; in (⇐) the
--   opening `rintro ⟨lt, ⟨hi, htr, htri⟩, hp⟩` destructures the
--   existential with the matching nested pattern, putting the four
--   hypotheses needed for the contradiction in scope under their
--   natural names.  Only the witness-assembly differs from a flat-4
--   encoding -- every other line (the `le₀` relation, the `hrefl` /
--   `htrans` / `hantisymm` lemmas, the `IsPreorder` / `IsPartialOrder`
--   typeclass promotions via `haveI`, the `extend_partialOrder` call,
--   the four sub-proofs of irreflexivity / transitivity / trichotomy /
--   parent-precedes, the `Walk.lt_of_directedWalk_pos` invocation) is
--   independent of the topological-order predicate's internal shape.
--
-- *Proof-only helpers (above the theorem, outside the marker zone).*
--   The walk-level plumbing -- `Walk.comp`, `Walk.length_comp`,
--   `Walk.isDirectedWalk_comp`, `Walk.source_in_G_of_directedWalk_pos`,
--   `Walk.target_in_G_of_directedWalk_pos`,
--   `Walk.singleEdge_directedWalk`, `Walk.lt_of_directedWalk_pos` --
--   is generic infrastructure: it operates on raw
--   `lt : Node → Node → Prop` plus the directed-walk recursion from
--   `def_3_6` and does not mention `IsTopologicalOrder`, so it is
--   unaffected by the predicate's packaging.  See the `## Proof-only
--   helpers` block at the top of the namespace for the documentation.
--
-- *Surface signature minimal.*  Only `(G : CDMG Node)` is hypothesised;
--   no `[Fintype Node]`, no re-stated CDMG-shape constraints, just the
--   chapter-standard `[DecidableEq Node]` binder from the surrounding
--   `variable` line.  Finite `J, V`, `Disjoint J V`, and
--   `E ⊆ (J ∪ V) × V` are baked into the `CDMG` record (`def_3_1`);
--   `[DecidableEq Node]` is what `G.IsAcyclic`'s `Walk.IsDirectedWalk`
--   recursion and `IsTopologicalOrder`'s `G.Pa w` reference
--   reach through to typecheck.  `[Fintype Node]` was considered (a
--   constructive topological-sort variant of the (⇒) direction can want
--   it locally to enumerate `(G.J ∪ G.V).toList`) and rejected at the
--   statement level: the `Finset`-valued `G.J` / `G.V` already supply
--   finiteness on `J ∪ V` -- exactly the domain on which the order
--   must be total -- so leaking the typeclass into the surface
--   signature would over-constrain consumers for no statement-level
--   gain.
--
-- *Labels `L` absent from both sides.*  `G.IsAcyclic` only inspects
--   directed walks built from `G.E`; `G.IsTopologicalOrder lt`
--   only references the parent set `Pa^G(w)` (a directed-edge
--   construct from `def_3_5`).  Neither reads `G.L`, matching the LN's
--   silence on labels here -- this is a property of the
--   `(J, V, E)`-skeleton alone.  Chapter 4+ consumers operating on
--   labelled (A)DMGs lose nothing by ignoring `G.L` here; acyclicity
--   and topological order are skeleton-level properties.
--
-- *Known limitation: non-canonical witness.*  The `∃` deliberately
--   does not designate a canonical topological order; many linear
--   refinements of the parent-precedence partial order qualify, and
--   the LN never picks one.  Downstream theorems that need to fix a
--   specific order pass `lt` as an explicit hypothesis or
--   `Classical.choice`-extract from the existential (inheriting the
--   non-canonicality).  This matches the LN's treatment and is
--   intentional, not an API gap.
