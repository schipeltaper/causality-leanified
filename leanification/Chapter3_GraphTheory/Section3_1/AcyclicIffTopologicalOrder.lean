# Acyclicity is equivalent to existence of a topological order (`claim_3_2`)

This file formalises the LN lemma block `claim_3_2` from `graphs.tex`,
immediately following `def-topological-order`:

> A CDMG `G = (J, V, E, L)` is acyclic if and only if it has a
> topological order.

The authoritative spec is the rewritten canonical tex statement at
`leanification/Chapter3_GraphTheory/Section3_1/tex/`
`claim_3_2_statement_AcyclicIffTopologicalOrder.tex`, verified
equivalent to the LN block.  The row carries an empty
`addition_to_the_LN`; the LN-critic wording-check returned
`NO_SUBTLETIES`.  The literal LN sentence is authoritative.

Both sides of the biconditional refer to upstream chapter-3 predicates
already in this folder:

* `G.IsAcyclic` from `def_3_6` (`Acyclicity.lean`) — there does not
  exist a non-trivial directed walk from any node `v ∈ J ∪ V` back to
  itself.
* `G.IsTopologicalOrder lt` from `def_3_8` (`TopologicalOrder.lean`) —
  the four-conjunct `Prop` predicate on an external relation
  `lt : Node → Node → Prop` asserting (i) irreflexivity on `J ∪ V`,
  (ii) transitivity on `J ∪ V`, (iii) trichotomy on `J ∪ V`, and (iv)
  `v ∈ Pa^G(w) → lt v w` (parents precede their children).

Because `def_3_8` characterises *which* relations qualify as a
topological order (rather than asserting one exists), "G has a
topological order" reads in Lean as the existential
`∃ lt : Node → Node → Prop, G.IsTopologicalOrder lt` — exactly the
shape that `def_3_8`'s "Downstream consumers" design block
anticipates.  The label set `L` of `def_3_1` plays no role on either
side of the biconditional; the result is a property of the
`(J, V, E)`-skeleton of `G` only.

The theorem body is filled in by `prove_claim_in_lean` (Manager B),
following the verified TeX proof at
`tex/claim_3_2_proof_AcyclicIffTopologicalOrder.tex`.  Proof-only
helpers (walk concatenation, source/target-in-`G` for non-trivial
directed walks, single-edge directed walk, walk-induction on `lt`)
live just below the `variable` block, outside the marker zones
because they are not statement content.

-- ## Design choice — statement context
--
-- *`Node : Type*` with `[DecidableEq Node]`.*  Inherited verbatim from
--   `def_3_1` (`CDMG.lean`).  Both fixtures are load-bearing here
--   because the theorem signature references `CDMG Node`, `G.IsAcyclic`
--   and `G.IsTopologicalOrder`, each of which depends on
--   `[DecidableEq Node]` (the `Finset`-backed membership tests in
--   `G.J ∪ G.V`, the `v ∈ G` quantifier scope via the `Membership`
--   instance from `def_3_2`, and the `Walk.IsDirectedWalk` recursive
--   check in `def_3_6` all require it).  Stronger instances
--   (`Fintype`, `LinearOrder`) are not needed at the statement level
--   and would over-commit — the proof body (handled separately) may
--   need them locally.

LN tex (verbatim from `graphs.tex`, the `\begin{Lem}` block
immediately following `def-topological-order`):

  A CDMG `G = (J, V, E, L)` is acyclic if and only if it has a
  topological order.

Rewritten canonical tex (see
`tex/claim_3_2_statement_AcyclicIffTopologicalOrder.tex`):

  Let `G = (J, V, E, L)` be a CDMG.  Then `G` is acyclic (in the sense
  of def_3_6) iff there exists a topological order of `G` (in the
  sense of def_3_8); equivalently, `G` is acyclic iff there exists a
  strict total order `<` on `J ∪ V` — i.e.\ a binary relation `<` on
  `J ∪ V` that is irreflexive, transitive, and trichotomous — such
  that, for every `v, w ∈ J ∪ V`, `v ∈ Pa^G(w) ⟹ v < w`.  The label
  set `L` plays no role on either side of the biconditional.
-/
-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Biconditional `↔` mirrors the LN's "if and only if" verbatim.*  A
--   single `Iff` packages both directions; consumers reach `.mp`
--   (acyclic ⟹ a topological order exists — the workhorse projection
--   for chapter 4–10's CBN factorisation, do-calculus, and
--   d-separation arguments that index a parent-first traversal over an
--   ADMG, since `IsADMG` carries `IsAcyclic` as its first conjunct per
--   `CDMGTypes.lean`) or `.mpr` (topological order ⟹ acyclic — the
--   certificate route used by causal-discovery algorithms in chapter
--   11+ that construct an ordering and need to conclude acyclicity)
--   without a per-direction lemma split.  Splitting into two named
--   theorems `acyclic_implies_topological_order` /
--   `topological_order_implies_acyclic` was considered and rejected:
--   the LN treats this as one claim, every downstream site we have
--   visibility into needs only one direction at a time (and reaches
--   it via `.mp` / `.mpr` at zero cost), and the bundled `↔` keeps
--   the LN ↔ Lean cross-reference grep-able under a single name.
--
-- *RHS is `∃ lt : Node → Node → Prop, G.IsTopologicalOrder lt` — an
--   existential over a bare relation, not over a bundled
--   `LinearOrder Node` / subtype-restricted strict-total-order
--   structure.*  Forced by `def_3_8`'s upstream design: its
--   `IsTopologicalOrder` is a property of an external `lt`, not a
--   bundled-existence structure (see `TopologicalOrder.lean`'s
--   "Predicate over an external ordering" block, whose "Downstream
--   consumers" paragraph literally anticipates this row's
--   `∃ lt, G.IsTopologicalOrder lt` shape).  Bundled alternatives
--   considered and rejected:
--   (a) `∃ lt : LinearOrder Node, …` — Mathlib's `LinearOrder` forces
--     totality / transitivity / antisymmetry on the *full* `Node`
--     type, excluding perfectly valid orders that leave nodes outside
--     `J ∪ V` unrelated; the LN only requires totality on `J ∪ V`.
--   (b) `∃ lt : StrictOrder ↥(G.J ∪ G.V), …` (subtype-restricted) —
--     avoids over-commitment but forces every downstream consumer to
--     coerce nodes across the `↥(G.J ∪ G.V)` boundary at every use
--     site.  `def_3_8` rejected this on the predicate side for the
--     same reason, and we inherit the choice here.
--   (c) A `∃!`-strengthened or `Classical.choice`-ed canonical order
--     would inject uniqueness / arbitrariness that the LN does not
--     commit to: many topological orders generally exist (any linear
--     refinement of the parent-precedence partial order qualifies),
--     and the LN never picks one.
--   Consumers `obtain ⟨lt, hlt⟩ := …` to get a concrete order, then
--   destructure `hlt` via `def_3_8`'s 4-conjunct
--   `⟨hi, htr, htri, hp⟩` shape.
--
-- *Only `(G : CDMG Node)` is hypothesised — no `[Fintype Node]`, no
--   re-stated CDMG-shape constraints, no extra typeclasses beyond the
--   chapter-standard `[DecidableEq Node]` binder.*  Every shape
--   constraint the biconditional rests on (finite `J, V`,
--   `Disjoint J V`, `E ⊆ (J ∪ V) × V`, label symmetry / irreflexivity)
--   is baked into the `CDMG` record from `def_3_1` (`CDMG.lean`);
--   `[DecidableEq Node]` on the surrounding `variable` line is what
--   `G.IsAcyclic` (its `Walk.IsDirectedWalk` recursion) and
--   `G.IsTopologicalOrder lt` (its `v ∈ G` quantifiers and `G.Pa w`
--   reference) reach through to typecheck.  `[Fintype Node]` was
--   considered — a constructive topological-sort proof of the `.mp`
--   direction may want it locally to enumerate `(G.J ∪ G.V).toList`
--   — and rejected at the *statement* level: the proof body's local
--   needs should not leak into the surface signature, and the
--   `Finset`-valued `G.J` / `G.V` already supply finiteness on
--   `J ∪ V`, which is exactly the domain on which the order must be
--   total.
--
-- *Labels `L` are correctly absent from both sides of the
--   biconditional.*  `IsAcyclic` (`def_3_6`) only inspects directed
--   walks built from `G.E`; `IsTopologicalOrder` (`def_3_8`) only
--   references the parent set `Pa^G(w)` (a directed-edge construct
--   from `def_3_5`).  Neither reads `G.L`, matching the LN's silence
--   on labels in this block.  Consumers operating on labelled graphs
--   (chapter 4–10 CBN / do-calculus arguments on ADMGs, where
--   bidirected `L`-edges encode hidden common causes) lose nothing by
--   ignoring `G.L` here — acyclicity and topological order are
--   properties of the `(J, V, E)`-skeleton alone.
--
-- *Mathlib re-use.*  None at the type / typeclass level for the
--   statement; the existential binds a bare `Node → Node → Prop`
--   rather than a Mathlib `LinearOrder` / `IsStrictTotalOrder`
--   instance, for the over-commitment reason above.  The proof body
--   (deferred to the sibling `prove_claim_in_lean` worker) is free to
--   invoke Mathlib's finite-set / Finset / List ordering machinery
--   locally — typical routes: for `.mp`, a recursive minimum-element
--   pick on `(G.J ∪ G.V).toList` driven by `def_3_6`'s `IsAcyclic`
--   ruling out empty-source obstructions; for `.mpr`, a `Walk`-length
--   induction contradiction combining irreflexivity, transitivity, and
--   parent-precedes from `def_3_8`'s 4-conjunct — without affecting
--   this statement's signature.
--
-- *Known limitation: non-canonical witness.*  The `∃` deliberately
--   does not designate a canonical topological order — many may exist
--   (any linear refinement of the parent-precedence partial order
--   qualifies), and the LN never picks one.  Downstream theorems that
--   need to fix a specific order must either pass `lt` as an explicit
--   hypothesis or `Classical.choice`-extract it at the use site
--   (inheriting the non-canonicality).  This matches the LN's
--   treatment and is intentional, not an API gap.
