# Predecessors of a vertex under a (topological) order (`def_3_9`)

This file formalises the LN definition block `def_3_9`
(`\label{def-predecessors}` in `graphs.tex`):

> Let `G = (J, V, E, L)` be a CDMG and `<` a total order of `J ∪ V`.
> The set of *predecessors* of `v` in `G` are:
>   `Pred^G_<(v) := {w ∈ G | w < v}`.
> We also put:
>   `Pred^G_≤(v) := {w ∈ G | w < v} ∪ {v}`.

The authoritative spec is the rewritten canonical tex statement at
`leanification/Chapter3_GraphTheory/Section3_1/tex/def_3_9_Predecessors.tex`,
which passed both `verify_tex_statement_only` (structural) and
`verify_tex_statement_equivalence` (semantic) against the LN block.
No `addition_to_the_LN` clauses are attached.  The rewrite folded
three working-phase wording-check subtleties directly into the
canonical tex as non-load-bearing clarifications:

* `ambiguous_w_in_G_notation` — the LN's "$w \in G$" is read as
  $w \in J \cup V$ via `def_3_2`'s `Membership Node (CDMG Node)`
  instance; the rewritten tex spells the set-builder body with
  $w \in J \cup V$ verbatim.
* `v_not_required_to_be_in_J_union_V` — the LN does *not* constrain
  $v$ to lie in $J \cup V$.  We follow the literal LN stance and take
  `v : Node` (unconstrained) below.  Corner case `v ∉ J ∪ V`: the
  strict body is empty (`<` is only supplied on `J ∪ V`), and the
  non-strict body degenerates to `{v}` (so `v ∈ Pred_≤ G lt v` even
  when `v` lies outside `J ∪ V`).  Downstream consumers that
  pattern-match on the shape of an element may add `v ∈ G` as a
  separate hypothesis at the point of use.
* `subscript_le_body_uses_strict` — the LN writes the non-strict
  variant's body as `{w | w < v} ∪ {v}` (strict comparison plus the
  singleton) rather than `{w | w ≤ v}`.  We implement the literal LN
  body `Pred lt v ∪ {v}`; the two forms coincide whenever
  `v ∈ J ∪ V` (irreflexivity of `<` keeps `v` out of the strict body
  while `w ≤ v` would pick it up via `v ≤ v`), and diverge only in
  the corner case above.

The strict order `<` is taken as a raw external argument
`lt : Node → Node → Prop`, matching the parameter convention of
`def_3_8`'s `IsTopologicalOrder` (`TopologicalOrder.lean`): the LN's
"Let `<` be a total order of `J ∪ V`" is realised by *passing* such
an `lt` to `Pred` / `PredLE`, not by carrying it on a `[LT Node]`
typeclass (which would force a single canonical `<` per `Node`
type — see the design block in `TopologicalOrder.lean` for the full
rejection of typeclass / structure encodings of "the order").
`Pred` / `PredLE` are *predecessor-set* primitives that *any* strict
relation may be plugged into; downstream consumers will typically
pass an `lt` carrying `G.IsTopologicalOrder lt`, but the
definitional shape does not require it.

-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Why add `(h : G.IsTotalOrder lt)` to the signature.*
--   Pre-refactor, `Pred G lt v` was well-typed for *any* binary
--   relation `lt`, but the LN's `Pred^G_<(v)` is only well-defined
--   when `<` is a total order on `J ∪ V` (the LN block opens
--   "*Let `<` be a total order of `J ∪ V`*").  This is exactly the
--   failure pattern `verify_equivalence` item~1a flags ("hypothesis
--   dropped from Lean's type contract; only documented in design
--   comments") and `verify_equivalence_strict`'s CONTENT example
--   calls "loosening a quantifier's domain": the pre-refactor `Pred`'s
--   "let `<` be a total order" premise lived only in 60+ lines
--   of design-choice comments, where the type checker cannot enforce
--   it on downstream consumers.  Adding `h` to the type contract closes
--   the leak at the source: every downstream consumer is now forced
--   to supply the total-order witness, rather than smuggling the LN
--   premise in at the use site or relying on documentation the type
--   system cannot inspect.  The pre-refactor `G.Pred lt v` and the
--   LN's `Pred^G_<(v)` were not the same mathematical object, even
--   though they coincide on the LN's intended inputs; the
--   post-refactor signature makes them coincide *by construction*.
--
-- *Why the helper is `IsTotalOrder` (not the full
--   `IsTopologicalOrder`).*  The LN's premise in this row
--   reads "*Let `<` be a total order of `J ∪ V`*" — nothing more.
--   The parent-precedence conjunct of `IsTopologicalOrder`
--   (`∀ v w, v ∈ G.Pa w → lt v w`) is *not* required for `Pred` to
--   be well-defined: the predecessor-set computation
--   `{w ∈ G | lt w v}` makes sense for any total order on `J ∪ V`,
--   topological or not.  Demanding the full `IsTopologicalOrder`
--   here would over-constrain consumers that legitimately want
--   predecessor sets for non-topological total orders — for example
--   chapter 5's ID-algorithm "preceding Markov blanket" slice
--   (id-algorithm.tex §"preceding Markov blanket", around lines
--   227–240), which carves `J ∪ V` into `{w | w < v}`, `{v}`,
--   `{w | v < w}` purely via the total-order content, and chapter
--   5's factorisation reverse-ordering step (id-algorithm.tex line
--   466).  Downstream consumers that *do* have a
--   `G.IsTopologicalOrder lt` witness in scope reach the
--   `IsTotalOrder` premise via the first projection
--   `(h_topo : G.IsTopologicalOrder lt).1 : G.IsTotalOrder lt` —
--   one-step, no plumbing.  Matches the helper-vs-full-predicate
--   split spelled out in the `IsTotalOrder` REPLACEMENT block in
--   `TopologicalOrder.lean`.
--
-- *LN-vs-downstream-usage tension worth flagging explicitly.*  A
--   future reader skimming the chapter-4+ call sites of `\Pred` will
--   notice that *every* downstream LN consumer — CBN factorisation
--   (chapter 4), do-calculus (chapter 5), σ-/d-separation (chapters
--   6–7), iSCM recursion (chapters 8–10), and most slices of the
--   ID-algorithm (chapter 5, e.g.\ id-algorithm.tex around lines
--   228, 248, 284, 348) — opens with "Let `<` be a *topological*
--   order of `G`", strictly stronger than def_3_9's own "Let `<` be
--   a *total order* of `J ∪ V`".  A reader inspecting that
--   chapter-4+ usage may therefore expect *this* signature to
--   require the full `G.IsTopologicalOrder lt` premise.  We
--   deliberately keep it at the weaker `IsTotalOrder` because
--   def_3_9's *own* LN block — the row being formalised here — asks
--   for nothing more.  Closing the loosened-domain leak without
--   silently *over*-tightening beyond def_3_9's literal phrasing is
--   what keeps the `Pred` primitive LN-faithful to *this row*, not
--   to its typical downstream call context.  Concrete consumers
--   where the weaker hypothesis genuinely matters: chapter 5's
--   ID-algorithm "preceding Markov blanket" slice
--   (id-algorithm.tex §lines 227–240, which carves `J ∪ V` purely
--   via total-order content with no parent-precedence) and the
--   factorisation reverse-ordering step (id-algorithm.tex line 466,
--   which reverses a total order — an operation on the total-order
--   content alone).  Every other chapter-4+ consumer with a
--   topological-order witness projects to `IsTotalOrder` via `.1`
--   at zero cost, so the weaker premise costs them nothing.
--
-- *Why the hypothesis is unused in the body (and named `_h`).*  The
--   hypothesis exists purely as a type-level contract.  The body is
--   unchanged from the original block (`{w | w ∈ G ∧ lt w v}` is the
--   literal LN spelling), and intentionally so: the strict-checker's
--   diagnosis was not that the body was wrong, but that the type
--   signature was too permissive.  Closing the type-level hole does
--   not require changing the predecessor-set computation itself,
--   which always made sense as `{w ∈ G | lt w v}` regardless of
--   whether `lt` carried the total-order content — the computation
--   just was not *justified* without that content.  The parameter
--   is bound with the leading-underscore name `_h` (the standard
--   Lean / Mathlib convention for "explicitly unused but
--   load-bearing in the type contract"): this silences the
--   `unusedVariables` linter while keeping the parameter positional
--   for callers (callers pass it as the third positional argument
--   regardless of the binder name, e.g.\
--   `PredLE` below writes `G.Pred lt h v` where
--   its own `h` flows into `Pred`'s `_h` slot).
--   `PredLE`'s own body *does* reference its `h` (to
--   forward it through the call to `Pred`), so there the
--   binder name stays `h` without a leading underscore.
--
-- *Carry-over rationales (from the ORIGINAL block above; cited
--   rather than full-restated — see that block for the long form).*
--   (a) `Set Node` return type: matches the chapter's `def_3_5`
--   family-set convention (`Pa`, `Ch`, `Sib`, `Anc`, `Desc`, `Sc`,
--   `Dist` are all `Set Node`-valued); composes naturally with
--   downstream `Pa^G(v)`, `Sib^G(v)` etc.\ via Mathlib's `Set` API
--   without `Finset.coe` round-trips.  `Finset Node` and
--   `↥(G.J ∪ G.V) → Set ↥(G.J ∪ G.V)` were considered and rejected
--   for decidability-threading and `Subtype.val` coercion reasons
--   spelled out in the ORIGINAL block.
--   (b) `w ∈ G` conjunct in the body: mirrors the LN's literal
--   `{w ∈ J ∪ V | w < v}`, makes the membership witness available
--   immediately on destructuring `h_w : w ∈ G.Pred lt h v`
--   as `⟨hw_mem, hw_lt⟩`, and preserves the literal LN grep
--   correspondence.  Wording-check subtlety
--   `ambiguous_w_in_G_notation` is resolved on the nose via
--   `def_3_2`'s `Membership Node (CDMG Node)` instance.
--   (c) `Prop`-valued `(h : G.IsTotalOrder lt)`, not a
--   typeclass `[G.IsTotalOrder lt]` or structure-field encoding:
--   matches the `lt` argument's own `Prop`-shape and avoids forcing
--   every consumer to thread `[G.IsTotalOrder lt]` brackets through
--   every signature.  The LN's reading is "*let `<` be a total
--   order*" — a *named property* of a chosen relation, not an
--   instance the resolver surfaces silently.  Same rationale as
--   the helper's own `def : Prop` shape in `TopologicalOrder.lean`'s
--   `IsTotalOrder` REPLACEMENT block (no-instance-plumbing,
--   no-wrapper-relation, no-bracket-threading at every use site).
--   (d) `v : Node` unconstrained: per the rewritten tex spec, the LN
--   does *not* impose `v ∈ J ∪ V`.  We follow the literal stance
--   and take `v : Node` raw.  Corner case `v ∉ G`: the strict body
--   is empty (no `w` has `lt w v` because `lt` is supplied only as
--   a total order on `J ∪ V` by `h`).  Adding a `(hv : v ∈ G)`
--   hypothesis was considered and rejected for the same reasons as
--   the ORIGINAL block: it would force every downstream call site
--   to supply the witness even when `v` lies in `G.J ∪ G.V` by
--   construction.
--
-- *Downstream consumers (post-refactor).*  Chapter 4 CBN
--   factorisation reads "for each `v ∈ V`, condition on the values
--   at `Pred^G_<(v) ∩ V`"; do-calculus (chapter 5) uses
--   `Pred^G_<(v)` to identify the temporal-ordering context of an
--   intervention; σ-/d-separation (chapters 6–7) take a topological
--   order from `claim_3_2`'s existential and quantify over
--   predecessors; iSCMs (chapters 8–10) recursively compute values
--   at `v` from values at `Pred^G_<(v)`.  Post-refactor, every such
--   consumer threads `h` through the call to `G.Pred lt h v`,
--   typically obtained via the first projection
--   `(h_topo : G.IsTopologicalOrder lt).1` from a topological-order
--   hypothesis already in scope.

-/
-- ## Design choice
--
-- *Why add `(h : G.IsTotalOrder lt)` to the signature.*
--   Same root cause as `Pred` above (see that REPLACEMENT
--   block for the full discussion): pre-refactor, `PredLE G lt v`
--   was well-typed for any binary relation `lt`, but the LN's
--   `Pred^G_≤(v)` is only well-defined when `<` is a total order on
--   `J ∪ V`.  This is the `verify_equivalence` item~1a /
--   `verify_equivalence_strict` "loosening a quantifier's domain"
--   failure: the LN premise lived in the 60+ lines of original
--   design comments rather than in the type contract.  Adding `h`
--   closes the leak at the source — and propagates through
--   `Pred`'s own signature, since the body calls
--   `G.Pred lt h v`.
--
-- *Why the helper is `IsTotalOrder`, not
--   `IsTopologicalOrder`.*  Same as `Pred`: the
--   LN's premise here is just "let `<` be a total order of
--   `J ∪ V`", not "let `<` be a topological order".  Demanding the
--   full topological-order shape would over-constrain consumers
--   that want non-strict predecessor sets purely under total-order
--   content (chapter 5's ID-algorithm "preceding Markov blanket"
--   slice; CBN factorisation's "earlier-than" context under an
--   analytical non-topological detour ordering).  Downstream
--   consumers with a topological-order witness project via `.1`.
--
-- *LN-vs-downstream-usage tension worth flagging (same point as
--   `Pred`'s LN-vs-downstream bullet above; cited rather
--   than full-restated).*  Every downstream LN consumer of
--   `\Pred_{≤}` opens with "Let `<` be a *topological* order" —
--   strictly stronger than def_3_9's own "Let `<` be a *total*
--   order of `J ∪ V`".  A reader inspecting chapter-4+ usage may
--   expect the stronger hypothesis here; we deliberately keep it
--   at the weaker `IsTotalOrder` because def_3_9's *own* LN block
--   — this row — asks for nothing more.  Consumers with a
--   topological-order witness project to `IsTotalOrder` via `.1`
--   at zero cost, so the weaker premise costs them nothing while
--   keeping `PredLE` LN-faithful to *this row*'s literal phrasing.
--
-- *Why `h` is unused in `PredLE`'s body, yet still
--   threaded through `Pred`.*  The hypothesis is purely a
--   type-level contract at the `PredLE` signature — its
--   role is to *force the caller* to supply a total-order witness,
--   not to be inspected in the body.  But the body calls
--   `G.Pred lt h v`, and the post-refactor `Pred` *does*
--   demand `h` on its own signature (same hypothesis, same role).
--   So `h` is forwarded through the call.  No inspection happens
--   on either side — the witness is plumbing, not data — but the
--   type contract is preserved end-to-end.
--
-- *Why the replacement calls `G.Pred lt h v` (prefixed),
--   not `G.Pred lt v` (unprefixed).*  During the refactor, both
--   the legacy `Pred` (no `h`) and the post-refactor
--   `Pred` (with `h`) coexist as top-level declarations of
--   `Causality.CDMG`.  The post-refactor `PredLE` must
--   wire to the post-refactor `Pred`, for two reasons.
--   (i) **Signature consistency:**  the legacy `G.Pred lt v` takes
--   no `h` argument, so calling it would not type-check with the
--   `h` we have in scope (it would leave `h` unused, but more
--   importantly would silently re-couple the post-refactor `PredLE`
--   to a no-hypothesis strict-predecessor primitive — defeating the
--   refactor's purpose, since every downstream `PredLE` proof would
--   then silently reach the leaky `Pred` rather than the
--   type-enforced `Pred`).
--   (ii) **Cleanup symmetry:**  cleanup renames `Pred`
--   → `Pred` and `PredLE` → `PredLE` globally; after that,
--   the unprefixed `PredLE`'s body will read `G.Pred lt h v`,
--   identical to the original wiring but with the threaded `h`.
--   Using the prefixed name *now* keeps the post-cleanup body
--   correct by construction.
--
-- *Carry-over rationales (from the ORIGINAL block above; cited,
--   not full-restated).*
--   (a) Literal LN body `G.Pred lt h v ∪ {v}`, NOT
--   `{w | w ∈ G ∧ (lt w v ∨ w = v)}` or `{w | w ∈ G ∧
--   Relation.ReflGen lt w v}`: the LN subscript reads "≤" but the
--   body it writes is strict, with `{v}` adjoined unconditionally.
--   Wording-check subtleties `v_not_required_to_be_in_J_union_V`
--   and `subscript_le_body_uses_strict` apply unchanged: in the
--   corner case `v ∉ G`, the strict body filters by `w ∈ G`, so
--   `v` is admitted into `PredLE G lt v` only via the adjoined
--   singleton — and the singleton has no `v ∈ G` guard.  Hence
--   `v ∈ PredLE G lt v` *unconditionally*, even for `v ∉ G`.  The
--   total-order hypothesis `h` does not change this corner-case
--   behaviour: `h` constrains `lt` on `J ∪ V`, not the surrounding
--   ambient `Node` type, so the body's set-theoretic semantics on
--   nodes outside `G` is identical to the pre-refactor reading.
--   Any downstream consumer that needs the cleaner form
--   `{w | w ≤ v}` can prove a one-step equivalence under the
--   additional hypothesis `v ∈ G` (plus irreflexivity of `lt`,
--   available via `h.1`).
--   (b) `G.Pred lt h v ∪ {v}` spelled with the named
--   strict predecessor, NOT unfolded to
--   `{w | w ∈ G ∧ lt w v} ∪ {v}`: reads on the nose as the LN's
--   "the strict predecessor set plus `v`" semantic story;
--   downstream proofs with `h_w : w ∈ G.Pred lt h v` in
--   scope use `Or.inl h_w` directly to obtain
--   `w ∈ G.PredLE lt h v` (Mathlib's `Set.mem_union` and
--   `Set.mem_singleton_iff` are the natural destructors).
--   (c) `Set Node` return type, `Prop`-valued `h`: same rationale
--   as `Pred` above.
--   (d) `{v}` parses as the `Set Node` singleton via
--   `Set.instSingleton`: Lean's elaboration sees `∪` on a
--   `Set Node` left-hand side and resolves the brace notation to
--   the matching `Set` instance, no explicit ascription needed.
--
-- *Refactor coexistence note.*  Both the prefixed `PredLE`
--   and the unprefixed `PredLE` live in this file as top-level declarations of
--   `Causality.CDMG` until Phase~7 cleanup.  Cleanup deletes the
--   originals and renames `Pred` → `Pred`,
--   `PredLE` → `PredLE` globally; after that, the
--   unprefixed `PredLE` will call the unprefixed `Pred`, identical
--   to the original wiring but with the threaded `h`.  No §3.1
--   row currently consumes `PredLE` (the refactor's `claim_3_2`
--   DEPENDENT row is included for `def_3_8`'s shape change, not
--   for `def_3_9` — `claim_3_2` does not touch `PredLE`), so the
--   build stays green throughout.
--
-- *Downstream consumers (post-refactor).*  Every chapter that
--   reasons modulo "the nodes up to and including `v`" — CBN
--   factorisation's conditioning argument (chapter 4),
--   do-calculus's "earlier-than" context (chapter 5), iSCM
--   recursion's "values determined by `Pred_≤`" (chapters 8–10) —
--   uses `PredLE`.  Post-refactor, those consumers thread the same
--   `h` (typically obtained via `.1` from a topological-order
--   hypothesis) that `Pred` requires.  The split between `Pred`
--   and `PredLE` is purely the strict-vs-non-strict variant the LN
--   explicitly introduces; both names appear under that
--   distinction in later chapters.
