# Acyclicity and topological orders survive hard intervention (claim_3_3)

This file formalises the lecture notes' remark immediately following
the definition of the hard intervention `G_{\doit(W)}` (def_3_10): if
`G` is acyclic, then so is `G.hardInterventionOn W`, and any
topological order of `G` is also a topological order of
`G.hardInterventionOn W`. See
`lecture-notes/lecture_notes/graphs.tex` Rem at lines 308 -- 313.

The LN bundles two distinct mathematical statements under one `\Rem`
block; we split them into two theorems because they carry different
hypotheses (see the per-theorem design notes below):

* `isAcyclic_hardInterventionOn` -- acyclicity is preserved with **no
  precondition** on `W`. Every directed edge of the intervened graph
  is a directed edge of `G` (by `mem_hardInterventionOn_E`), so every
  directed walk in `G.hardInterventionOn W` lifts to a directed walk
  in `G` of the same length; a cycle would therefore lift back to one
  in `G`. New input vertices in `W \ (G.J ∪ G.V)` participate in no
  edges (by `G.E_subset` / `G.L_subset`) and are vacuously safe.

* `isTopologicalOrder_hardInterventionOn` -- the topological order is
  preserved under the **precondition** `W ⊆ G.J ∪ G.V`. With the
  precondition the node set `(G.hardInterventionOn W).J ∪
  (G.hardInterventionOn W).V` equals `G.J ∪ G.V`, so the four
  `IsTopologicalOrder` fields (`irrefl` / `trans` / `trichotomous` /
  `parent_lt`) transport verbatim from `hr : G.IsTopologicalOrder r`.
  Without the precondition a vertex in `W \ (G.J ∪ G.V)` would sit in
  the intervened graph's node set but be unconstrained by `hr`,
  breaking `irrefl` / `trichotomous` in general.

## Where this gets used downstream

* **claim_3_4** (`graphs.tex` Lem 317, "hard interventions commute")
  -- uses the acyclicity preservation when iterating
  `(G.hardInterventionOn W₁).hardInterventionOn W₂`.
* **claim_3_5** (`graphs.tex` Prp 360) -- bifurcation
  characterisations via `Anc^{G_{\doit(w)}}(v)` need `G_{\doit(w)}`
  acyclic to talk about topological orders on it.
* **claim_3_8 / claim_3_11** -- disjoint hard interventions inherit
  acyclicity from this row by iteration.
* **Chapters 4 -- 6 (CBNs, do-calculus, ID-algorithm)** -- the
  soundness arguments take a CADMG `G` with a topological order `<`
  and rewrite identification problems via `G_{\doit(W)}`; the
  topological order on `G_{\doit(W)}` is read off as the same `<`
  thanks to `isTopologicalOrder_hardInterventionOn`.
* **Chapters 8 -- 10 (iSCMs)** -- the unique-solution theory of
  intervened iSCMs recurses along a topological order of the
  intervened graph; that order is the *same* relation as the original
  by this row.

/-! ### Edge-shrinkage walk-lifting helpers

These private helpers are the *single engine* of both halves of
`claim_3_3`: hard intervention only ever shrinks the edge sets
(`(G.hardInterventionOn W).E ⊆ G.E` via `mem_hardInterventionOn_E`,
`(G.hardInterventionOn W).L ⊆ G.L` via `mem_hardInterventionOn_L`),
so every step / walk in `G.hardInterventionOn W` can be lifted to a
step / walk in `G` by re-typing the underlying adjacency proof.

Part A uses the walk lift to transport a hypothetical directed
cycle in `G.hardInterventionOn W` back to `G`; Part B uses the
edge-step half of the same machinery to transport `parent_lt`.

The lift is length- and `IsDirected`-preserving (the two lemmas
below). Kept `private` because they encode the edge-shrinkage idiom
for *this* row's proof; future rows that need the same lift from a
more general edge-subgraph (e.g. claim_3_4's iterated intervention)
can promote them to public lemmas when the use case actually
arrives. -/

/-- Lift a `WalkStep` in `G.hardInterventionOn W` to a `WalkStep`
in `G`. Each constructor's underlying adjacency proof is a member of
the strictly larger base edge / latent set, so the lift is just a
re-typing -- the `(G.hardInterventionOn W).E ⊆ G.E` /
`(G.hardInterventionOn W).L ⊆ G.L` inclusions are *definitional* set
differences, so `.1` extracts the `G.E` / `G.L` membership directly. -/

/-- claim_3_3 part A: if `G` is acyclic then so is
`G.hardInterventionOn W`, for *any* `W : Set α`. Mirrors the first
half of the `\Rem` immediately after def_3_10 in
`lecture-notes/lecture_notes/graphs.tex` (line 311).

We split the LN's single `\Rem` into two theorems because the
acyclicity and topological-order halves carry different
hypotheses, and different downstream consumers pattern-match on
different halves. `claim_3_4` ("hard interventions commute") and
the iSCM uniqueness theory of chapters 8 -- 10 need acyclicity of
the intervened graph *alone* -- they have no named topological
order on hand, so a bundled conjunction would force them either
to project, or to drag in the `W ⊆ G.J ∪ G.V` precondition that
part B (`isTopologicalOrder_hardInterventionOn`) requires but
part A does not. The downstream consumers of part B in
`do_calculus.tex` / `id_algorithm.tex` carry a named `<` through
long proofs and likewise prefer the relation-level form on its
own, without the acyclicity conjunct.

No `W ⊆ G.J ∪ G.V` precondition appears here because every
directed edge of `G.hardInterventionOn W` is a directed edge of
`G` (by `mem_hardInterventionOn_E` in `HardInterventionOn.lean`),
so directed walks in the intervened graph lift to walks of the
same length in `G` and any cycle would lift to a cycle in `G`.
Spurious vertices in `W \ (G.J ∪ G.V)` participate in no edges
at all (by `G.E_subset` on the source / `G.L_subset` on both
endpoints), so they cannot host a cycle either. For the same
reason no `[Finite α]` instance is required -- the walk-lifting
argument is purely structural (edges shrink under intervention),
and adding finiteness would block downstream use in iSCM
chapters working over not-yet-finitised vertex types. `W` is an
*explicit* binder because consumers (claim_3_4, claim_3_5,
iSCMs) typically have a specific `W` in mind that is not
unifiable from elsewhere, while `G` is implicit because it is
recovered from `(G.hardInterventionOn W).IsAcyclic`. The name
follows Mathlib's `<conclusion>_<construction>` convention --
the `IsAcyclic` predicate first, then the `hardInterventionOn`
construction we are showing preserves it. -/

-- title: AcyclicUnderIntervention -- topological order preserved
--
-- If `r` is a topological order of `G` and `W ⊆ G.J ∪ G.V`, then `r`
-- is also a topological order of `G.hardInterventionOn W`. The
-- `W ⊆ G.J ∪ G.V` precondition is essential here even though it is
-- *not* needed for part A: `IsTopologicalOrder G' r` quantifies over
-- nodes of `G'`, and the intervened graph's node set is
-- `(G.J ∪ W) ∪ (G.V \ W)`. With the precondition this collapses to
-- `G.J ∪ G.V`, so the four `IsTopologicalOrder` fields transport
-- directly from `hr`. Without it, a vertex in `W \ (G.J ∪ G.V)` would
-- be a node of the intervened graph but `hr.irrefl` / `hr.trichotomous`
-- would say nothing about it, so the conclusion would fail in general.
-- The `parent_lt` field also transports because edges shrink under
-- intervention: `Pa (G.hardInterventionOn W) w ⊆ Pa G w` (a directed
-- edge of the intervened graph is a directed edge of `G`, by
-- `mem_hardInterventionOn_E`).
/-- claim_3_3 part B: if `W ⊆ G.J ∪ G.V` and `r` is a topological
order of `G`, then `r` is also a topological order of
`G.hardInterventionOn W`. Mirrors the second half of the `\Rem`
immediately after def_3_10 in
`lecture-notes/lecture_notes/graphs.tex` (line 311); see
`isAcyclic_hardInterventionOn` above for the rationale behind
splitting that `\Rem` into two theorems and for the downstream
consumers of the acyclicity half.

The `W ⊆ G.J ∪ G.V` precondition that was *absent* in part A is
*essential* here: `IsTopologicalOrder G' r` quantifies its four
fields (`irrefl` / `trans` / `trichotomous` / `parent_lt`) over
the nodes of `G'`, and `(G.hardInterventionOn W).J ∪
(G.hardInterventionOn W).V = (G.J ∪ W) ∪ (G.V \ W)` collapses to
`G.J ∪ G.V` only when `W ⊆ G.J ∪ G.V`. Without the precondition
a vertex `v ∈ W \ (G.J ∪ G.V)` would be a node of the intervened
graph that `hr.irrefl` / `hr.trichotomous` say nothing about,
breaking those fields in general. Part A escaped this issue
because its walk-lifting argument only touches
`(G.hardInterventionOn W).E ⊆ G.E`, never the node set of the
intervened graph.

`W` and `r` are both implicit because they are unifiable from the
hypotheses (`hW : W ⊆ G.J ∪ G.V` and
`hr : G.IsTopologicalOrder r`) and from the conclusion
`.IsTopologicalOrder r`; downstream callers in
`do_calculus.tex` / `id_algorithm.tex` carry a fixed named `<`
through long proofs and pass it through `hr`, so they never need
to spell `r` (or `W`) at the call site -- they simply write
`isTopologicalOrder_hardInterventionOn hW hr`. `G` is implicit
for the same reason it is in part A. Naming follows Mathlib's
`<conclusion>_<construction>` convention, consistent with part A
and with the `IsTopologicalOrder` predicate's own naming in
`Section3_1/TopologicalOrder.lean`. -/
